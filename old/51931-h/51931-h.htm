</div>

<p class='c019'>This book is written because it seems to be
needed. The author has been repeatedly requested
by Ministers, Y. M. C. A. Secretaries,
Christian Workers, and his own students to
put into a permanent and convenient shape
the substance of what he has said at Conventions,
Summer Schools and in the class–room
on personal work. The time has come
to yield to these requests. Never before in
the history of the Church were there so many
who desire to win others to Christ. The good
work done by the Young People’s Society of
Christian Endeavor is in no other direction
so evident as in the many thousands of young
people in this land who to–day are on fire
with a desire to win souls. But while they
desire to do this work, many do not know
how. This little book aims to tell them.
There are several well–known and valuable
manuals of texts to be used with inquirers,
but this book is intended not only to point
out passages to be used but to show how to
use them, illustrating this use by cases from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>actual experience. It is hoped that from a
careful study of these pages any earnest Christian
can learn how to do efficient work in
bringing others to the Saviour.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='1'>I.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF SUCCESS IN BRINGING MEN TO CHRIST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There are certain general conditions, the
fulfilment of which is absolutely essential to
real success in bringing men to Christ. These
conditions, fortunately, are few and simple
and such as any one can meet.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <i>The one who would have real success in
bringing others to Christ must himself be</i> <span class='fss'>A
THOROUGHLY CONVERTED PERSON</span>.  Jesus said
to Peter, “When thou art <em>converted</em> strengthen
thy brethren.” He was in no position to help
his brethren until he himself, after his cowardly
denial, had turned again to his Lord with
his whole heart. If we would bring others to
Christ we must turn away from all sin,
and worldliness and selfishness with our
whole heart, yielding to Jesus the absolute
lordship over our thoughts, purposes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>actions.  If there is any direction in which
we are seeking to have our own way and not
letting Him have His own way in our lives,
our power will be crippled and men lost that
we might have saved. The application of
this principle to the numerous questions that
come up in the life of every young Christian
as to whether he should do this or that, each
individual can settle for himself if Christ’s
honor and not his own pleasure is upper–most
in his mind and if he looks honestly to
God to guide him.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <i>The one who would have real success in
bringing others to Christ must have a</i> <span class='fss'>LOVE
FOR SOULS</span>, <i>i. e.</i> <i>a longing for the salvation of
the lost</i>. If we have no love for souls, our
efforts will be mechanical and powerless. We
may know how to approach men and what
to say to them, but there will be no power in
what we say and it will not touch the heart.
But if like Paul we have “great heaviness and
unceasing pain in our hearts” for the unsaved,
there will be an earnestness in our tone and
manner that will impress the most careless.
Furthermore if we have a love for souls we
will be on the constant watch for opportunities
to speak with the unsaved and will find
opportunities on the street, in the store, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the home, on the cars and everywhere that
would otherwise have entirely escaped our
notice.</p>

<p class='c023'>But how is one to get a love for souls? This
question is easily answered. First of all, a
love for souls like <a id='tn009'></a>every other grace of Christian
character, is the work of the Holy Spirit.
If then we are conscious that we do not have
that love for souls that we should have, the
first thing to do is to go to God and humbly
confess this lack in our lives and ask Him by
His Holy Spirit to supply that which we so
<a id='tn009_2'></a>sorely need, and expect Him to do it (<a id='tn009_3'></a><abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr>
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 14, 15; <abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 19). In the second
place Jesus Christ had an intense love for
souls (<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='23'>xxiii.</abbr> 37; Luke <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 10), and
intimate and constant companionship with
Him will impart to our lives this grace
which was so prominent in His. In the
third place feelings are the outcome of
thoughts. If we desire any given feeling in
our lives we should dwell upon the thoughts
which are adapted to produce that feeling.
If any saved person will dwell long enough
upon the peril and wretchedness of any man
out of Christ and the worth of his soul in
God’s sight as seen in the death of God’s
Son to save him, a feeling of intense desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>for that man’s salvation is almost certain to
follow. In the fourth place, reflection upon
our own ruined and unhappy condition without
Christ and the great sacrifice that Christ
made to save us, is sure to fill our hearts with
a desire to bring others to the Saviour we have
found.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <i>The one who would have real success
in bringing men to <a id='tn010'></a>Christ must have a</i> <span class='fss'>WORKING
KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIBLE</span>.  The Word of
God is the sword of the Spirit (<abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 17).
It is the instrument God uses to convict of
sin, to reveal Christ and to regenerate men.
If we would work together with God, the Bible
is the instrument upon which we must rely
and which we must use in bringing men to
Christ. We must know how to use the Bible
so as (1) to show men their need of a Saviour,
(2) to show them Jesus as the Saviour they
<a id='tn010_2'></a>need, (3) to show them how to make this
Saviour their own <a id='tn010_3'></a>Saviour, (4) to meet the
difficulties that stand in the way of their accepting
Christ. A large part of the following
pages will be devoted to imparting this knowledge.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. <i>The one who would have real success
in bringing men to Christ must</i> <span class='fss'>PRAY MUCH</span>.
Solid work in soul winning must be accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>by prayer at every step. (1). We
must pray God to lead us to the right persons
to approach. God does not intend that we
speak to every one we meet. If we try to do
it, we will waste much valuable time in speaking
to those whom we cannot help, that
we might have used in speaking to those
to whom we could have done much
good. God alone knows the one to
whom He intends us to speak, and we must
ask Him to point him out to us, and, expect
Him to do it. (Acts <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 29). (2). We
must pray God to show us just what to say
to those to whom He leads us. After all our
study of the passages to be used in dealing
with the various classes of men, we shall
need God’s guidance in each specific case.
Every experienced worker will testify to the
many instances in which God has led them
to use some text of Scripture that they would
not otherwise have used but which proved to
be just the one needed. (3). We must pray
God to give power to that which He has given
us to say. We need not only a message from
God but power from God to send the message
home. Most workers have to learn this lesson
by humiliating experiences. They sit down
beside an unsaved man and reason and plead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and bring forth texts from the word of God,
but the man does not accept Christ. At last
it dawns upon them that they are trying to
convert the man in their own strength and
then they lift an humble and earnest prayer
to God for his strength, and God hears and in
a short time this “very difficult case” has settled
the matter and is rejoicing in Christ. (4).
We must pray God to carry on the work after
our work has come to an end. After having
done that which seems to have been our
whole duty in any given instance, whatever
may have been the apparent issue of our work,
whether successful or unsuccessful, we should
definitely commit the case to God in prayer.
If there is anything the average worker in this
hurrying age needs to have impressed upon
him, it is the necessity of more prayer. By
praying more we will not work any less and
we will accomplish vastly more.</p>

<p class='c019'>5. <i>The one who would have real success in
bringing men to Christ must be</i> “<span class='fss'>BAPTIZED
WITH THE HOLY GHOST</span>.” “Ye shall receive
power after that the Holy Ghost, is come
upon you,” said Jesus to his disciples after
having given them the great commission to go
out and bring men to Himself. The supreme
condition of soul winning power is the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to–day: “after that the Holy Ghost is come
upon you.” A later chapter will be given to
a study of what “the Baptism of the Holy
Ghost” is and how any Christian can obtain it.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='2'>II.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>HOW TO BEGIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>When God has led us to think that He
wishes us to make an effort to lead some given
individual to Christ, the first question that
confronts us is, “How shall I begin?” If the
person has gone into an inquiry room, or remained
to an after–meeting, or even if they are
merely present at prayer–meeting, Sunday–school
or other ordinary service of the church,
it is comparatively easy. You can then ask
him if he is a Christian, or if he would not
like to be a Christian, or why he is not a
Christian or some other direct and simple
question that will lead inevitably to a conversation
along this line. But if the person
is one in whom you have become interested
outside the religious meeting and who is perhaps
an entire stranger, it does not at first
sight appear so simple, and yet it is not so
very difficult. The person can be engaged in
conversation on some general topic or on
something suggested by passing events, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>soon brought around to the great subject.
Christ’s conversation with the woman of Samaria
in the 4th chapter of John is a very instructive
illustration of this. Oftentimes even
in dealing with entire strangers it is well to
broach the subject at once and ask them if
they are Christians or if they are saved or
some similar question. If this is done courteously
and earnestly it will frequently set even
careless people to thinking and result in their
conversion. It is astonishing how often one
who undertakes this work in humble dependence
upon God and under His direction, finds
the way prepared and how seldom he receives
any rebuff. One day the writer met a man
on one of the most crowded streets of Chicago.
As I passed him the impulse came to speak
to him about the Saviour. Stopping a moment
and asking God to show me if the impulse was
from Him, I turned around and followed the
man. I overtook him in the middle of the
street, laid my hand upon his shoulder and
said: “My friend, are you a Christian?” He
started and said: “That’s a strange question
to ask a man.” I said, “I know it, and I do
not ask that question of every stranger, but
God put it into my heart to ask it of you.”
He then told me that his cousin was a minister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and had been urging this very matter upon
him, that he himself was a graduate of Amherst
college, but had been ruined by drink.
After further conversation we separated but
later the man accepted Christ as his Saviour.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is often best to win a person’s confidence
and affection before broaching the subject.
It is well to select some one and then lay
your plans to win him to Christ. Cultivate
his acquaintance, show him many attentions
and perform many acts of kindness great
and small and at last when the fitting moment
arrives take up the great question. An old
and thorough going infidel in Chicago was in
this way won to Christ by a young woman,
who found him sick and alone. She called
day after day and showed him many kindnesses
and as the consumption fastened itself
more firmly upon him she spoke to him of
the Saviour and had the joy of seeing him accept
Christ.</p>

<p class='c023'>A wisely chosen tract placed in the hand
of the one with whom you wish to speak will
often lead easily and naturally to the subject.
One day I was riding on a train and praying
that God would use me to lead some one to
His Son. A young lady, daughter of a minister,
with whom I had had some conversation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>on this subject came in with a friend and took
the seat immediately in front of me. I took
out a little bundle of tracts and selected one
that seemed adapted for the purpose and
handed it to her and asked her to read it. As
she read, I prayed. When she had finished,
I leaned over and asked her what she
thought about it. She was deeply moved and
I asked her if she would not accept Christ
right there. Her difficulties were soon met
and answered and she accepted Christ. As
she left the train she thanked me very heartily
for what I had done for her.</p>

<p class='c023'>You will often meet some one whose face
tells the story of unhappiness or discontent:
in such a case it is easy to ask the person if
he is happy and when he answers “no” you
can say, “I can tell you of one who will make
you happy if you will only take Him.” Skill
in beginning a conversation will come with
practice. One may be rather awkward about
it at first but as we go on we will acquire
facility.</p>

<p class='c023'>When the subject is once opened the first
thing to find out is where the person with
whom you are dealing stands; then you will
know how to wisely treat his case. In the
chapters immediately following this all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>classes of men one is likely to meet will be
given, and the first point to be ascertained is
to which class any given individual belongs.
But how can we find out to which class any
person belongs? First. By asking him questions.
Such questions as “Are you a Christian?”
“Are you saved?” “Do you know
that your sins are forgiven?” “Have you eternal
life?” “Are you confessing Christ openly
before the world?” “Are you a friend of
Jesus?” “Have you been born again?” One
may answer these questions untruthfully,
either through ignorance or a desire to mislead
you. Nevertheless, their answers and
the manner of them will show you a great deal
about their real state. Second. By watching
his face. A man’s face will often reveal
that which his words try to conceal. Any one
who cultivates the study of the faces of those
with whom he deals will soon be able to tell
in many instances the exact state of those
with whom they are dealing irrespective of
anything they may say. Third. By the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit if we only look
to Him to do it will often flash into our minds
a view of the man’s position, and just the
scripture he needs.</p>

<p class='c023'>When we have learned where the person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>with whom we are dealing stands, the next
thing to do is to lead him as directly as we
can to accept Jesus Christ, as his personal
Savior and Master. We must always bear in
mind that the primary purpose of our work,
is not to get persons to join the church or
to give up their bad habits or to do anything
else than this, to accept Jesus Christ, as their
Saviour—the one who bore their sins in his
own body on the tree and through whom they
can have immediate and entire forgiveness,—and
as their Master to whom they surrender
absolutely the guidance of their thoughts, feelings,
purposes and actions. Having led any
one to thus accept Christ the next step will
be to show him from God’s word that he has
forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr>
43; <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 39; <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36; <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 24, will answer
for this purpose. The next step will be to
show him how to make a success of the
Christian life upon which he has entered.
How to do this will be told later. Each
person is to be led to accept Christ through
a use of the word of God. In the chapters
that immediately follow this we will try
to show what specific portions of the word to
use in given cases and how to use them.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='3'>III.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THE INDIFFERENT OR CARELESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>One of the classes of men most frequently
met with, is The Indifferent, or Careless.
There are several ways of dealing with
them. One is to show them their need of a
Saviour. A good verse to use for this purpose
is Romans <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 23. Get the person with
whom you are dealing to read the verse, “For
all have sinned and come short of the glory
of God.” Then say to him: “Who have
sinned?” “All<a id='tn020'></a>.” “Who does that include?”
and keep up the questioning until he says,
“It includes me.” Then ask him what it is
that he has done, and keep at it until he
comes out plainly and says: “I have sinned
and come short of the glory of God.” This
is likely to make him feel his need of a
Saviour. Another good verse to use is Isaiah
<abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 6. After the verse has been read, ask
him who it is that has gone astray and by a
series of questions bring him to the point
where he will say, “I have gone astray.” Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>ask him what kind of a sheep one is that has
<a id='tn021'></a>“gone astray” and hold him to it until he says
“a lost sheep.” “What are you then?” “Lost.”
Then ask him what the Lord has done with
his sin, and hold him to that point until he
sees the truth of the verse, that God has laid
his sin on Jesus Christ. Now, he is in a
position for you to put to him the direct question:
“Will you accept this Saviour upon whom
the Lord has laid your sin?” Still another
verse to use is Psalms <abbr title='130'>cxxx.</abbr> 3. When the
verse has been read, ask him, “If the Lord
marked iniquities could you stand?” In dealing
with this class of men I use Matthew <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr>
37, 38 more frequently than any other passage
of Scripture. Before having the person
read the verse, it is well to ask him, “Do you
know that you have committed the greatest
sin that a man can commit?” In all probability
he will answer, “No, I have not.” Then ask
him what he thinks the greatest sin a man can
commit. When he has answered, say to him,
Now let us see what God considers the greatest
sin. Read the verses and ask him, “What is
the first and greatest of the commandments?”
Then ask him, “What then is the greatest
sin?” He will soon answer that the violation
of the first and greatest of the commandments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>must be the greatest sin. Ask him if he has
kept that commandment and when he confesses,
as sooner or later he must, that he has
not, ask him of what he is guilty in the sight
of God, and hold him to that point until he
admits that he is guilty of committing the
greatest sin that a man can commit. An illustration
from life may help to make the use
of this verse clear. I was dealing with a
very bright young man who evidently had no
deep sense of sin nor of his need of a Saviour.
In fact when I asked if he was a Christian he
said promptly that he always had been; but
there was something in his manner that showed
that he had no clear understanding of what it
meant to be a Christian. I then asked if he
had been born again and he did not even understand
what I was talking about. I next
asked if he knew he had committed the greatest
sin that a man could possibly commit and
he at once answered, “No, I never did in my
life.” I asked what he considered the greatest
sin, and he replied “murder.” I took my
Bible and opened it to Matthew <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 37,
38, and asked him to read the verses, which
he did. I then asked him, “If this is the first
and greatest commandment, what must be
the greatest sin<a id='tn022'></a>?” He answered, “I suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the breaking of that commandment.” I then
asked if he had always kept that commandment,
if he had always loved God with
all his heart, with all his soul, and with all
his mind. If he had always put God first in
everything. He replied that he had not. I
then asked him, “Of what then are you guilty?”
The Spirit of God carried the text home and
with the greatest earnestness he replied, “I
have committed the greatest sin that a man
can commit, but I never saw it before in my
life.” Another verse that can be used with
effect is John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 34. After the man has
read the verse, “Whosoever committeth sin is
the servant of sin,” ask him “what is one who
commits sin?” Then ask him if he commits sin.
Then put to him the direct question, “What
are you then,” and hold him to it until he
says “the servant of sin.” Then ask him if he
does not desire to be delivered from that awful
bondage. Hold him to this point until
he sees his need of Jesus Christ as a Deliverer
from the slavery of sin. The Holy Spirit has
used Isaiah <abbr title='57'>lvii.</abbr> 21 to the salvation of
many men who have been indifferent to the
claims of the Gospel. After the verse, “There
is no peace saith my God to the wicked,” has
been read slowly, thoughtfully, and earnestly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>ask him who it is that says this. Then
ask him if it is true; then ask him if it is true
in his case. “Have you peace?” One night
a careless young man was going out of one of
our tents in Chicago and as he passed by me
I took him by the hand and said to him, “You
need the Saviour.” He wanted to know why
I thought so. I replied, “Because you have
no peace.” He said, “Yes I have.” “No you
have not.” He then asked me how I knew
that. I told him God said so and quoted the
above passage. He tried to laugh it off and
say the verse was not true in his case. Then
he became angry and went out of the tent in
a rage, but the next night I saw him kneeling
with one of our workers in prayer and when
he arose from his knees, the worker came over
and said he wished to speak with me. As I
approached him he held out his hand and
said, “I wanted to beg your pardon for what
I said last night; what you said was true, I
didn’t have peace.” I asked him if he had
now accepted the Saviour. He said he had.</p>

<p class='c023'><a id='tn024'></a>Galatians <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 10 is a verse which we very
frequently use in our work in dealing with
the Indifferent. After the one with whom
you are dealing has read the verse, “For
as many as are of the works of the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>are under the curse; for it is written cursed
is every one that continueth not in all things
which are written in the book of the law to
do them” ask him the question, “What is
every one that continueth not in all things
which are written in the book of the law to
do them?” When he answers, “Cursed,”
ask him if he has continued in all things
which are written in the book of the law to
do them and when he replies, “No, I have
not,” put to him the direct question, “What
are you then?” and hold him to that point
until he says, “I am under the curse.” In very
many cases the inquirer will be ready at once
to be led to the thirteenth verse of the same
chapter which shows how he may be saved
from that curse under which he rests. Romans
<abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 23 can often be used with good effect.
“For the wages of sin is death.” Ask “what
are the wages of sin?” Then, “who earns
those wages?” Then, “Are you a sinner?”
“What wages then have you earned?” “Do
you wish to take your wages<a id='tn025'></a>?” John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36 is
a verse which can be used in a similar way.
Ask the question, “Upon whom is it that the
wrath of God abides?” Then, “Do you believe
on the Son?” “What then abides upon
you?” Then put the decisive question, “Are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>you willing to go away with the wrath of
God abiding upon you?” <abbr title='Second Thessalonians'>2 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 7‒9,
and John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 24; <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 15; <abbr title='20'>xxi.</abbr> 8; <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr>
10‒11, set forth in a most impressive way the
awful consequences of sin. If these verses
are used they should be read with the deepest
earnestness and solemnity and dwelt upon
until the person with whom you are dealing
realizes their terrible import.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is another way to arouse a man from
his indifference, and that is by showing what
Jesus has done for him. I have found Isaiah
<abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 5‒6 more effectual for this purpose <a id='tn026'></a>than
any other passage in the Bible. An incident
from life will illustrate its use. A lady had
asked prayers for her daughter, a young
woman about twenty years of age. At the
close of the services I stepped up to the
daughter and asked her if she would not accept
Jesus Christ as her Saviour at once.
She stamped her foot in anger and said, “My
mother should have known better than to do
that; she knows it will only make me worse.”
I asked her if she would not sit down for a
few minutes and as soon as we were seated I
opened my Bible to this passage and began to
read, “But he was wounded for our transgressions,
he was bruised for our iniquities;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
and with his stripes we are healed. All we
like sheep have gone astray; we have turned
every one to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all.” I made
no comment upon the verses whatever, but
the Spirit of God carried them home and
tears began to roll down the cheeks of the
young woman. She did not come out as a
Christian that night but did shortly afterward.
It is well in using these verses, whenever it
is possible, to get the inquirer to change the
pronoun from the plural to the singular. “He
was wounded for <em>my</em> transgressions; he was
bruised for <em>my</em> iniquities, etc.” John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 16
can be used in a similar way. I was talking
one night to one who was apparently most
indifferent and hardened. She told me the
story of her sin, with seemingly very little
sense of shame, and when I urged her to
accept Christ, she simply refused. I put a
Bible in her hands and asked her to read this
verse. She began to read, “God so loved
the world that He gave His only begotten
Son,” and before she had finished reading the
verse she had broken into tears, softened by
the thought of God’s wondrous love to her.
First Peter <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 24 is a verse of similar character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Ask the inquirer whose sins they were
that Jesus bore in his own body on the tree,
and hold him to it until he says, “My sins.”
<abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18‒19; Luke <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 44; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='27'>xxvii.</abbr> 46, are useful as bringing out in detail
what Christ has suffered for us.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is still another way to arouse indifferent
persons, and that is by showing them
that the one damning sin is that of which
they themselves are guilty—the sin of rejecting
Jesus Christ. <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28‒29 is very effective
for this purpose. John <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 9; <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 18,
19, 20, and Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 36 can also be used.</p>

<p class='c023'>Oftentimes you will meet one who is not
willing to sit down and let you deal with him
in this deliberate way. In that case the only
thing to do is to look up to God for guidance
and power and give him some pointed verse
in great earnestness, such for example as
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28‒29; Romans <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 23; John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36;
Isaiah <abbr title='57'>lvii.</abbr> 21, and leave it for the Spirit of
God to carry the truth home to his heart. A
passing shot of this kind has often resulted
in the salvation of a soul. The passages given
above can be wisely used with one who is not
altogether indifferent or careless but who has
not a sufficiently deep sense of sin and need
to be ready to accept the Gospel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='4'>IV.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO BE SAVED BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There is a very large class of persons who
are anxious to be saved but simply do not
know how. It is not difficult to lead this
class of persons to Christ. Perhaps no other
passage in the Bible is more used for this purpose
than Isaiah <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 6. It makes the way of
salvation very plain. Read the first part of
the verse to the inquirer, “All we like sheep
have gone astray, we have turned every one
to his own way.” Then ask, “Is that true of
you,” and when he has thought it over and
said “yes,” then say to him, “Now let us see
what God has done with your sins,” and read
the remainder of the verse, “And the Lord
hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.”
“What then is it necessary for you to do to
be saved?” Very soon he can be led to see
that all that it is necessary for him to do is to
accept the sin bearer whom God has provided.
Some years ago I noticed in a meeting a white–haired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>man who did not stand up with the
Christians. At the close of the service I
walked down to him and said, “Are you not
a Christian?” He said he was not. I was
sure he was interested, so I put to him the
direct question, “Would you become a Christian
to–night if I would show you the way?”
and he replied that he would. We sat down
together and I opened my Bible to Isaiah <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr>
6 and read the first part of the verse, “All we
like sheep have gone astray, we have turned
every one to his own way.” I then said to
him, “Is that true of you?” and he answered
“yes.” “Now,” I said, “let us read the rest of
the verse, ‘And the Lord hath laid on him
the iniquity of us all.’” “What has the Lord
done,” I said, “with your sins?” He thought a
moment and said “he has laid them on Christ.”
“What then” I said “is all that you have to
do to be saved?” and he replied quite promptly,
“Accept him.” “Well,” I said, “will you accept
him to–night?” He said, “I will.” “Let us
then kneel down and tell God so.” We knelt
down and I led in prayer and he followed in
a very simple way telling God that he was a
sinner but that he believed that He had laid
his sins upon Jesus Christ, and asking God for
Christ’s sake to forgive his sins. When he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>had finished I asked him if he thought God
had heard his prayer and that his sins were
forgiven, and he said “yes.” I then asked
him if he would begin to lead a Christian life
at once, set up the family altar and openly
confess Christ before the world, and he replied
that he would. Some months after I
met his pastor and made inquiries about him
and found that he had gone to his home in a
distant village, set up the family altar and
united with the church together with his
son, the only remaining member of the
family out of Christ. Apparently all that
this man was waiting for was for some
one to make the way of salvation plain to
him. I sometimes put it this way in using
this verse: “There are two things which a
man needs to know and one thing he needs
to do in order to be saved. What he needs to
<em>know</em> is, first, that he is a lost sinner and this
verse tells him that; second, that Christ is
an all–sufficient Saviour and this verse tells
him that. What he needs to <em>do</em> is simply to
accept this all–sufficient Saviour whom God
has provided.” John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12 brings out this
thought very clearly, “As many as <em>received
him</em> to them gave he power to become the
sons of God, even to them that believe on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>his name.” After the verse has been read
you can ask the one with whom you are dealing,
“To whom is it that God gives the power
to become the sons of God<a id='tn032'></a>?” “As many as
receive him.” What must you then do to
become a son of God? “Receive him.” Well,
will you receive him as your Saviour and as
your master now? Isaiah <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 7; Acts <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 31;
John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 16 and <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36 are all useful in making
the way of salvation plain. John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 14
compared with Numbers <abbr title='21'>xxi.</abbr> 8 and the following
verses, can often be used with good
effect. When they are used you should lead
the inquirer to see just what the serpent–bitten
Israelite had to do to be saved—that he
had simply to look at the brazen serpent lifted
up upon the pole—then show him that the
sin–bitten man has to do simply the same
thing—look at <a id='tn032_2'></a>Christ lifted up on the Cross
for his sins. Romans <a id='tn032_3'></a><abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 16 is another excellent
verse to use. It makes the way of salvation
very clear. You can ask the inquirer
whom it is, according to his verse, that the
Gospel saves, and he will see that it is “every
one that believeth.” Then ask him, “What then
is all that is necessary for one to do in order to
be saved,” and he will see that it is simply to
believe. Then ask him “believe what,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the answer is “the Gospel.” The next question
that naturally arises is, what is the Gospel<a id='tn033'></a>?
This is answered by <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr>; 1‒4. These
verses show what the Gospel is, “that Christ
died for our sins according to the Scriptures;
that he was buried and that he rose the third
day according to the scriptures” and this is
what he must believe in order to be saved.
He must believe from his heart that Christ
died for his sins and that he rose again. Then
ask the inquirer, “do you believe that Christ
died for your sins? do you believe that he
rose again?” If he says that he does, ask
him if he will make this a heart faith and get
down and ask God for Christ’s sake, to forgive
his sins and believe he does it because he
says so, and then trust in the living Saviour
to save him day by day from the power of sin.
Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 9–10 also makes the way of salvation
clear to many minds where other verses
fail. Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 13 makes it, if possible,
more simple still. This shows that all that a
man has to do to be saved is to “call upon the
name of the Lord.” You can ask the inquirer
“Are you ready now and here to get down and
call upon the name of the Lord for salvation
and to believe that God saves you because
he says he will<a id='tn033_2'></a>?” The way of salvation can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>made plain by the use of Exodus <abbr title='12'><abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr></abbr> 7, 13,
23. These verses show that it was the blood
that made the Israelites safe and just so it is
to–day the blood that makes us safe, and when
God sees the blood he passes over us. The
only thing for us to do is to get behind the
blood. Then show the inquirer that the way
to be behind the blood is by simple faith in
Jesus Christ. Luke <abbr title='18'><abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr></abbr> 10–14 is exceedingly
useful in showing what a man may have
and yet be lost (the Pharisee) and what a
man may lack and yet be saved (the Publican)
and that all that a man has to do to be
saved is simply to do as the Publican did, that is
take the sinner’s place and cry to God for
mercy and then he will go down to his house
justified. This passage can be used in the
following manner to make the meaning more
clear. Ask the inquirer, “Which one of these
two (the Pharisee or the Publican) went down
to his house justified?” Then ask him, “What
did the Publican do that the Pharisee did not
do, that brought him the forgiveness of his
sins while the Pharisee went out of the Temple
unforgiven?” When he studies the passage
he will soon see that what the Publican
did was simply to take the sinner’s place before
God and cry for mercy and that as soon as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>did this he was “justified” or forgiven. Then
you can ask him, “What is all that it is necessary
for you to do to find forgiveness?”
Then ask him, “Will you do it now and here?”
and when he has done so ask him if he believes
God’s word and if he is going down to his
house justified. What saving faith is, is beautifully
illustrated by Luke <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 48–50. The
fiftieth verse tells us that this woman had
saving faith. Now ask the inquirer, “What
was the faith she had,” and show him that
her faith was simply such faith that Jesus
could and would forgive her sins, that she
came to him to do it. This is saving faith.
<a id='tn035'></a>Galatians <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 10–13 also makes the way <a id='tn035_2'></a>of
salvation very simple. The tenth verse shows
the sinner’s position before accepting Christ—“under
the curse.” The thirteenth verse shows
what Christ has done—has been made a curse
for us. What the sinner had to do is, evidently,
simply to accept Christ.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='5'>V.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ARE ANXIOUS TO BE SAVED AND KNOW HOW,  BUT WHO HAVE DIFFICULTIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>A very large number of persons whom we
try to lead to Christ, we will find are really
anxious to be saved and know how, but are
confronted with difficulties which they deem
insurmountable.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. One of the difficulties is, “<i>I am too great
a sinner</i>.” <abbr title='First Timothy'>1 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 15 meets this fully.
One Sunday morning a man who had led a
wild and wandering life and who had recently
lost $35,000 and been separated from his
wife, said to me in response to my question,
why he was not Christian, “I am too great a
sinner to be saved.” I turned at once to
<abbr title='First Timothy'>1 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 15. “This is a faithful saying and
worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners, of whom I
am chief.” He quickly replied, “well, I am the
chief of sinners.” “Well,” I said, “that verse
means you then.” He replied, “It is a precious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>promise.” I said, “Will you accept it now?” and
he said, “I will.” Then I said, “Let us kneel
down and tell God so,” and we knelt down and
he confessed to <a id='tn036'></a>God his sins, and asked God
for Christ’s sake to forgive him his sins. I
asked him if he had really accepted Christ and
he said he had. I asked him if he really believed
that he was saved and he said he did.
He took an early opportunity of confessing
Christ. He left the city in a short time but
I was able to follow him. He became a most
active Christian, working at his business day
times but engaged in some form of Christian
work every night in the week. He was reunited
to his wife and adopted a little child
out of an orphan asylum and had a happy
Christian home. Luke <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 10 is also a very
useful passage to use in dealing with this
class of men; especially useful when a man
says, “I am lost.” You can say, “I have a passage
intended expressly for you. If you really
mean what you say, you are just the man
Jesus is seeking. ‘For the Son of man is
come to seek and save that which was lost<a id='tn037'></a>.’”
Romans <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 6‒8 is a very effective passage. I
stopped a man one night as he was hurrying
out of a meeting. Laying my hand on his
shoulder I said “Did you not hold your hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>up to–night for prayers?” He said “yes.” I
said, “Why then are you hurrying away? Do
you know God loves you?” He replied,
“You do not know who you are talking to.”
“I do not care who I am talking to but
I know God loves you.” He said: “I am
the meanest thief in Minneapolis.” I said “If
you are the meanest thief in Minneapolis,
then I know God loves you,” and I opened
my Bible to Romans <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 8. “But God commendeth
his love toward us in that while we
were yet sinners Christ died for us.” “Now,”
I said, “If you are the meanest thief in Minneapolis,
you are a sinner, and this verse tells
that God loves sinners.” The man broke down
and going into another room with me told me
his story. He was just out of confinement
for crime; had started out that very night to
commit what he said would have been one of
the most daring burglaries ever committed in
the city of Minneapolis; with his two companions
in crime he was passing a corner where
he happened to hear an open–air meeting going
on and stopped a few minutes to hear
and in spite of the protests and oaths of his
companions stayed through the meeting and
went with us to the Mission. After telling
me his story we kneeled in prayer. Through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>tears he cried to God for mercy, having been
led by God’s precious promise to believe that
God loved a sinner even as vile as he. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 12, 13; Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 13 (Emphasize “whosoever”);
John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 16 (Emphasize the “whosoever”);
Isaiah <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18; <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='1'>iv.</abbr> 14; John <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 1‒2;
Isaiah <abbr title='44'>xliv.</abbr> 22; Isaiah <abbr title='43'>xliii.</abbr> 25 are also useful
passages in dealing with this class of men.
Isaiah <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18 and <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='51'>li.</abbr> 14 are especially useful
in dealing with men who have committed murder.
Never tell any one that his sins are not
great. It is well sometimes to say to these
men, “Yes, your sins are great, greater than
you think, but they have all been settled”
and show them Isaiah <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 6; <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 24.
A woman once came to me in great agitation.
After many ineffectual attempts she was at last
able to unburden her heart. Fourteen years
before she had killed a man and had borne
the memory of the act upon her conscience
until it had almost driven her crazy. When
she told the story to another Christian and
myself, we turned to Isaiah <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 6. After
reading the verse very carefully to her, I asked
her what the Lord had done with her sin.
After a few moments<a id='tn039'></a>’ deep and anxious
thought she said, “He has laid it on Christ,”
I took a book in my hand. “Now<a id='tn039_2'></a>,” I said “let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>my right hand represent you, and my left
hand Christ, and this book your sin.<a id='tn040'></a>” I laid
the book upon my right hand and I said:
“Where is your sin now?” She said “On
me.” “Now,” I said, “what has God done with
it?” She said “Laid it on Christ,” and I laid the
book over on the other hand. “Where is
your sin now?” I asked. It was long before
she could summon courage to answer, and
then with a desperate effort she said, “On
Christ.” I said, “then is it on you any <a id='tn040_2'></a>longer?”
Slowly the light came into her face and
she burst out with a cry, “No, it is on Him,
it is on Christ.” John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 29; Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 43;
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 25, are also helpful texts in dealing
with this class of men.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. Another difficulty we frequently meet
with, is “<i>I can’t hold out</i>,” or “<i>I am
afraid of failure</i>.” <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 5 is useful in
showing that we are not to keep ourselves but
are “kept by the power of God.” John <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr>
28, 29 shows that the safety of the one who
accepts Christ does not depend upon his
“holding out” but upon the keeping power of
the Father and the Son. <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12 shows
that it is Christ’s business and not ours to
keep that which is entrusted to him and that
he is able to do it. Isaiah <abbr title='41'>xli.</abbr> 10, 13 are also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>helpful. Jude 24 shows that whether we can
keep from falling or not, Christ is able
to keep us from falling. <a id='tn041'></a><abbr title='Second Chronicles'>2 Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='32'>xxxii.</abbr> 7, 8;
Romans <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 4; <abbr title='Second Thessalonians'>2 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 3, are also good
texts to use. <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 13 is especially useful
when one is afraid that some great temptation
will overtake him and he will fall.</p>

<p class='c019'>3.  Another difficulty very similar to the
preceding one, is “<i>I am too weak</i>.” With
such a person, use <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 9, 10. Ask him
“where is it that Christ’s strength is made
perfect?” When he answers “in weakness,”
tell him “then the weaker you are in your own
strength the better.” Philippians <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 13 shows
that however weak we may be, we can do
all things through Christ which strengtheneth
us.  <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 13 will show that God
knows all about our weakness and will not
permit us to be tempted above our strength.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. “<i>I cannot give up my evil ways or
bad habits.</i>” <abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 7, 8, will show them
that they must give them up or perish. Philippians
<abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 13 will show them that they can
give them up in Christ’s strength. It is an
excellent plan to point the one who fears that
he cannot give up his bad habits, to Christ,
as a risen Saviour, <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 3, 4. A man
once came to me and said: “I come to you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>know if there is any way I can get power to
overcome my evil habits.” He told me his
story; he had been converted in childhood but
had come to Chicago, fallen in with evil companions
and gone down, and now could not
break away from his sins. I said to him: “You
know only half the gospel, the gospel of a
crucified Saviour. Through trusting in the
crucified Saviour you found pardon. But Jesus
Christ is also a risen Saviour, <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 4, ‘All
power is given unto Him,’ <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='28'>xxviii.</abbr> 18.
He has power to give you victory over your
evil habits. Do you believe that?” He said,
“yes<a id='tn042_2'></a>.” “You trusted,” I continued, “in the
crucified Christ and found pardon, did you
not<a id='tn042_3'></a>?” “Yes,” he replied. “Now,” I said, “will
you trust the risen Christ to save you from
the power of your sins?” “Yes, I will.” “Let
us kneel down then, and tell him so.” We
knelt and talked it all over with the Saviour.
When he arose his very countenance was
changed. “I am so glad I came<a id='tn042_4'></a>,” he said.
Some time after I received a letter from him
telling me how he found constant victory
through trusting in the <em>risen</em> Christ.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='ch05s5'></a>5. “<i>I will be persecuted if I become a Christian.</i>”
Never tell any one that he will not be
persecuted, but show him from such passages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>as <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 12; <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>iii.</abbr> 12; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 10,
11, 12; Mark <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 35; Acts <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 22, that persecution
is the only path to Glory. Show them
from Romans <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 18 that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared
with the Glory which shall be revealed in us.
Show them from Acts <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 41; <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 20, 21,
that it is a privilege to be persecuted for
Christ’s sake. <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 2, 3 is useful in showing
them where to look for victory in persecution.</p>

<p class='c019'>6. “<i>It will hurt my business</i>,” or “<i>I can’t
be a Christian in my present business</i>.” Point
such an one to Mark <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 36. This will show him
that it is better to lose his business than to
lose his soul. After this thought has been sufficiently
impressed upon his mind, show him
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 32, 33 which contains God’s promise
that if we put God and His <a id='tn043'></a>kingdom first,
that He will provide for all our real temporal
needs. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 24‒27; Luke <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 16‒21; <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 24‒26
are also very effective passages to use
with this class.</p>

<p class='c019'>7. “<i>Too much to give up.</i>” Mark <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 36
will show them that they had better give up
everything than to lose their soul. Philippians
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 7, 8; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 11 will show them that what
they give up is nothing compared with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>they get. <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='84'>lxxxiv.</abbr> 11; Romans <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 32 will
show them that God will not ask them to give
up any good thing; in other words, that the only
things God asks them to give up are the things
that are hurting them. A young woman once
refused to come to the Saviour saying, “There
is too much to give up.” “Do you think God
loves you?” I answered. “Certainly.” “How
much do you think he loves you?” She
thought a moment and answered, “Enough to
give his son to die for me.” “Do you think,
if God loved you enough to give his son to
die for you, he will ask you to give up anything
it is for your good to keep?” “No.” “Do
you wish to keep anything that it is not for
your good to keep?” “No.” “Then you had
better come to Christ at once.” And she did.
<abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 17; Luke <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 16‒21 will show them
how worthless are the things which they
are trying to keep.</p>

<p class='c019'>8. “<i>The Christian life is too hard.</i>” Say
to the inquirer, “Let me show you from God’s
word that you are mistaken about the Christian
life being hard.” Then turn him to <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 30; <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 17; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 11; <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 3,
and show him that a Christian life is not hard
but exceedingly pleasant. Then turn him to
<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 15, and show him that it is the sinner’s
life that is hard.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>9.  “<i>I am afraid of my ungodly companions</i>;”
or “<i>I will lose my friends if I take
Christ</i>.” <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 25 will show them the consequence
of yielding to the fear of man and the
security of the one who trusts in the Lord.
<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 20 will show them the result of holding
on to their companions, and <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 1 will
show the blessedness of giving up evil companions.
<abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 3 shows how much better
companionship one gets than he loses by coming
to Christ.</p>

<p class='c019'>10. “<i>My heart is too hard.</i>” <abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr> <abbr title='36'>xxxvi.</abbr>
26, 27, will show them that though their hearts
are hard as stone, that will make no difference
because God will give them a new heart.</p>

<p class='c019'>11. “<i>I have no feeling.</i>” Ask the inquirer
what kind of feeling he thinks he must have
before he comes to Christ. If it is the peace
of which Christians speak, show him from
<abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 22; <abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 13; Acts <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 32; <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr>
8; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 32, that this feeling is the result of
accepting Christ and confessing Him, and
that he cannot expect it until he accepts and
confesses Christ. If the feeling which he
thinks he must have is the feeling that he is a
sinner, then show him by <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 7 that it is <em>not
the feeling</em> that we are sinners that God demands,
<em>but a turning away</em> from sin. Or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>from Acts <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 31; John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12; that God does
not ask us to feel that we are sinners but to
confess that we are sinners and trust in
Christ as a Saviour. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 1; <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 17,
will show the inquirer that all the feeling he
needs is a desire for salvation.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is often times well, however, with this
class of inquirers to show them the passages
for “<a href='#ch03'>The Indifferent</a>” until they do feel that
they are sinners.</p>

<p class='c019'>12. “<i>I am seeking Christ, but cannot find
Him.</i>”</p>

<p class='c023'><abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 13, shows that when we seek him
with the whole heart we shall find him.
Speaking with a woman one evening in an
after–meeting she said to me, “I have been
seeking Christ two years and cannot find Him.”
I replied, “I can tell you when you will find
him.” She looked at me in surprise and I
turned to <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 13, and read “And ye shall
seek me, and find me, when ye shall search
for me with all your heart.” “There,” I said,
“that shows you when you will find Christ.
You will find him when you search for him
with all your heart. Have you done that?”
After a little thought she answered “No.”
“Well, then,” I said, “let us kneel <a id='tn046'></a>right down
here now.” She did this and in a few moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>she was rejoicing in Christ. You can point one
who has this difficulty to Luke <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 1‒10; <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr>
10. These passages show that Jesus is seeking
the sinner and you can say, “if you are
really seeking Christ it will not take a seeking
Saviour and a seeking sinner very long to find
each other.”</p>

<p class='c019'>13. “<i>I cannot believe.</i>”</p>

<p class='c023'>In most cases where one says this the real
difficulty which lies back of their inability to
believe is unwillingness to forsake sin. John
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 44, is a good passage to use with such a
one, or <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 7. In the use of the latter
passage, hold the man’s attention to the fact
that all God asks of him is that he turn away
from sin and turn to Him.</p>

<p class='c019'>14. “<i>God won’t receive me</i>,” or “<i>I have
sinned away the day of grace</i>,” or “<i>I am
afraid I have committed the unpardonable
sin</i>.”</p>

<p class='c023'>The people who honestly say this, are as a
rule about the most difficult class to deal
with of any that you will meet. John <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 37,
is the great text to use with them for it shows
that Jesus will receive any one who will come
to him. Hold him continually to that point,
“Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
cast out” and if they keep saying “He won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>receive me” repeat the text, looking to the
Spirit of God to carry the truth home. Many
an utterly despondent soul has found light
and peace through this verse in God’s word.
<abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 17, is also useful as it shows that
any one who will can have the water of life
freely. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 1, shows that any one who desires
salvation can have it. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18, shows
that no matter how great a man’s sins may
be still here is pardon. Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 43, and John
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 16, that “<em>whosoever</em>” will believe upon
Christ will find pardon and eternal life.
Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 13, shows that any one, no
matter who or what he is, who will “call
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
It is well sometimes to turn to <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 4‒6,
and <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 31‒32, and show the inquirer
just what the unpardonable sin is and what
its results are. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 31, 32, shows that
it is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost and
put it squarely to him, “have you ever blasphemed
against the Holy Ghost?” <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr>
4‒6, shows that the difficulty is not in God’s
unwillingness to forgive, but in the man’s
unwillingness to repent and that any one who
is concerned about his salvation evidently
has not committed the unpardonable sin nor
sinned away his day of grace. A little instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>along this line is often times all that
is needed.</p>

<p class='c019'>15. “<i>It is too late.</i>”</p>

<p class='c023'>When an inquirer says this, it is often
times well to use <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 2, and tell him
that God says, it is just the time. Luke <abbr title='23'>xxiii.</abbr>
39‒43, is useful as showing that even at the
last hour Jesus will hearken to the sinner’s
cry. <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 9, will show that His will is
that none should perish, but that He is delaying
the judgment that He may save as many
as will come. <abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 30, 31, is an especially
helpful passage as it says “Even in the
latter days” if thou turn to the Lord he will
be <a id='tn049'></a>merciful. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18, and <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 17, can
alone be used here.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='6'>VI.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING <a id='tn050'></a>WITH THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN FALSE HOPES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>1. Among those who entertain false hopes,
perhaps the largest class are <i>those who expect
to be saved by their righteous lives</i>.
These persons are easily known by such sayings
as these, “I am doing the best I can.”
“I do more good than evil.” “I am not a
great sinner.” “I have never done anything
very bad.” <abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 10, is an excellent passage
to use, for it shows that all those who
are trusting in their works are under the curse
of the law and that there is no hope on the
ground of the law for any one who does not
“continue in all things which are written in
the book of the law to do them.” James <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr>
10 is also useful. <abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 16, and Romans
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 19, 20 are very effective by showing that
by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in God’s sight. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 20—All
these passages show the kind of righteousness
God demands and that no man’s righteousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>comes up to God’s standard, and that if a man
wishes to be saved he must find some other
means of salvation than by his own deeds.
It is sometimes well in using these passages
to say to the inquirer: “You do not understand
the kind of righteousness that God demands
or you would not talk as you do. Now
let us turn to His word and see what kind of
righteousness it is that God demands.” There
is another way of dealing with this class, by the
use of such passages as Luke <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 15; <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 16;
<abbr title='First Samuel'>1 Sam.</abbr> <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 7. These passages show that God
looks at the heart. Hold the inquirer right to
that point. Every man when brought face
to face with that, must tremble because he
knows that whatever his outward life may
be, his heart will not stand the scrutiny of
God’s eye. No matter how selfrighteous a
man is, we need not be discouraged for somewhere
in the depths of every man’s heart is
the consciousness of sin and all we have to
do is to work away until we touch that point.
Every man’s conscience is on our side. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 37, 38 can be used when a man says “I
am doing the best I can, or doing more good
than evil.” Say to him, “You are greatly mistaken
about that; so far from doing more
good than evil, do you know that you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>broken the first and greatest of God’s laws?”
Then show him the passage. <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 6,
John <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 29, show that the one thing that God
demands is faith and that without that it is
impossible to please God, and John <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 9,
shows that unbelief in Christ is the greatest
sin. John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36, shows that the question of
eternal life depends solely upon a man’s accepting
or rejecting Jesus Christ, and <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr>
28, 29, that the sin which brings the heaviest
punishment is that of treading under foot the
Son of God. Before using this latter passage, it
would be well to say, “You think you are very
good, but do you know that you are committing
the most awful sin in God’s sight which
a man can commit?” If he replies, “No<a id='tn052'></a>,” then
say “Well let me show you from God’s word
that you are;” then turn to this passage and
read it with great solemnity and earnestness.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. Another class of those who entertain
false hopes, are <i>those who think</i> “<i>God is too
good to damn anyone</i>.”</p>

<p class='c023'>When any one says this, you can reply, “We
know nothing of God’s goodness but what we
learn from the Bible, and we must go to that
book to find out the character of God’s goodness.
Let us turn to Romans <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 2, 4, 5.” Having
read the verses, you can say something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>like this, “Now, my friend, you see that the
purpose of God’s goodness is to lead you to
<a id='tn053'></a>repentance, not to encourage you in sin and
when we trample upon his goodness, then
we are treasuring up wrath against the day of
wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment
of God.” John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 21, 24 and <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36,
will show the man that however good God
may be that he will reject all who reject His
Son. Still another way to deal with these
men is by showing them from John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 40; <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr>
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 9‒11 or <abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr> <abbr title='33'>xxxiii.</abbr> 11, that it is
not so much God who damns men as men
who damn themselves in spite of God’s goodness
because they will not come to Christ and
accept the life freely offered. You can say
“God is not willing that any should perish
and he offers life freely to you, but there is
one difficulty in the way. Let us turn to
John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 40, and see what the difficulty is.”
Then read the passage: “Ye will not come to
me that ye might have life,” and say, “My
friend here is the difficulty, you won’t come;
life is freely offered to you but if you will not
accept it, you must perish.” <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 4‒6, 9;
Luke <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 3, show how the “good” God deals
with persons who persist in sin. Sometimes
this last passage can be effectively used in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>this way: “You say God is too good to damn
any one. Now let us see what God Himself
says in his word.” Then turn to the passage
and read, “Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish.” Repeat the passage over and
over again until it has been driven home.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. A third class of those who entertain false
hopes, are <i>those who say “I am trying to be a
Christian.”</i> John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12, will show them that
it is not “trying” to be a Christian or “trying”
to live a better life or “trying” to do anything
that God asks of us, but simply to receive
Jesus Christ, who did it all, and you can ask
the inquirer, “will you now stop your trying
and simply receive Jesus as Saviour?” Acts
<abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 31, shows that God does not ask us to
<em>try</em> what we can do but <em>trust</em> Jesus and what
He has done and will do. Romans <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 23‒25,
shows that we are not to be justified by trying
to do, “but freely by His grace, through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus” on the simple
condition of faith.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. Still another class of those who entertain
false hopes are <i>those who say</i>, “<i>I feel I
am going to Heaven</i>,” or “<i>I feel I am saved</i>.”
Show them from John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36 that it is not a
question of what they feel but what God says,
and what God says distinctly in his word is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>that, “He that believeth not on the Son, shall
not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
him.” One afternoon I was talking with a
lady who a few weeks before had lost her only
child. At the time of the child’s death she
had been deeply interested, but her serious impressions
had largely left her. I put to her
the question, “Do you not wish to go where
your little one has gone?” She replied at once
“I expect to.” “What makes you think you
will?” I said. She replied, “I feel so, I feel that
I will go to heaven when I die.” I then asked
her, if there was anything she could point to
in the word of God which gave her a reason
for believing that she was going to heaven
when she died. “No,” she said, “there is not.”
Then she turned and questioned me, saying,
“Do you expect to go to heaven when you die?”
“Yes<a id='tn055'></a>,” I replied, “I know I shall.” <a id='tn055_2'></a>“How do
you know it?” she said. “Have you any word
from God for it?” “Yes,” I answered and turned
her to John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36. She was thus led to see the
difference between a faith that rested upon
her feelings and a faith that rested upon the
word of God.</p>

<p class='c023'>Luke <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr> 9‒14, can also be used in
the following way; you can say “there was
a man in the Bible who felt he was all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>right, but was all wrong. Let me read
you about him.” Then read about the
Pharisee who was so sure that he was all
right, but who was all the time an unforgiven
sinner; and make the inquirer see how untrustworthy
our feelings are and what the ground
of <a id='tn056'></a>assurance is, viz: God’s word. <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 12
can also be used as showing that “there is a way
which seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the ways of death.”</p>

<p class='c019'>5. The last class of those who entertain
false hopes, are <i>those who say they are saved
though they are leading sinful lives</i>. In the
case of many forms of sin, a good passage to
use is <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 9‒10. <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 29 will also
in many cases sweep away this false hope. <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr>
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 4‒5 is useful as showing that one who
is really born of God overcomes the world and
the fact that they are living in sin and are not
overcoming the world is evidence that they
have not been born of God.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='7'>VII.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'><span class='sc'>Dealing with those who Lack Assurance and with <a id='tn057'></a>Back–sliders</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><abbr title='1'>I.</abbr> <span class='sc'>Those who Lack Assurance.</span></p>

<p class='c023'>Those who lack assurance may be divided
into two classes.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <i>Those who lack assurance because of ignorance.</i>
<abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 13, will show all such that
we may know that we have eternal life. Often
times when you ask people if they know they
are saved, or if they know their sins are forgiven,
or if they know they have eternal life,
they will reply, “Why no one knows that.”
You can say to them, “Yes the Bible says that
all who believe may know it,” and then show
them <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 13. John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12 shows that
Christ gives to as many as receive Him, power
to become the Sons of God. A good way to
use this verse is to ask the inquirer questions
regarding it. “What does every one who receives
Him receive power to become?” The
inquirer if he is attentively looking at the
verse will answer, “A son of God.” Then ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the next question, “Have you received Him?<a id='tn058'></a>”
If he replies “Yes,” then ask him, “What are
you then?” It will probably be necessary to go
over it several times but at last the inquirer
will see it and say “I am a son of God.”
John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36 can be used in a similar way. Ask
the inquirer “who do these verses say has everlasting
life?” “He that believeth on the Son.”
“Do you believe on the Son?” “What have
you then?” In a little while he will see it and
say “Everlasting life.” Then have him say
over and over again “I have everlasting life,”
and have him kneel down and thank God for
giving him everlasting life. One night I found
a young man upon his knees at the close of
the service in great distress. I showed him
from the Bible how Jesus Christ had borne
his sins and asked him if he would accept
Christ as his Saviour; he said he would; but
he seemed to get no light and went out of the
meeting in deep distress. The next night he
was there again, professing to have accepted
Christ but with no assurance that his sins
were forgiven. I tried to show him from God’s
word what God said of those who accepted
the Saviour, but the light did not come. Finally
he rose to leave the meeting. I had just
shown him from John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36 that God said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>that “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting
life.” As he turned to leave me, he
said, “Will you pray for me?” I said “Yes.”
He walked a little way down the aisle and I
called to him and said, “Do you believe I will
pray for you?” He turned with a look of astonishment
and replied, “Yes, of course.”
“Why do you think I will pray for you?” I
then asked. “Because you said so,” he replied.
I said “Isn’t God’s word as good as mine?”
He saw it at once, that while he had been
willing to believe my word, he had not been
willing to believe God’s word, and he received
assurance on the spot and knew that he had
everlasting life. John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 24 and <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 12
can be used in a similar way.</p>

<p class='c023'>Acts <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 39 is very useful in dealing with
this class of persons. Ask the inquirer:
“What does this verse say that all who believe
are?” “Justified<a id='tn059'></a>.” Then ask him, “Do you
believe?” “What are you then?” It will
probably take two or three times going over
it before he sees it and when he answers “I
am justified,” tell him to thank God for justifying
him and confess Christ, and see to it
that he does so. Many inquirers of this class
stumble over the fact that they have not the
witness of the Holy Spirit. Show them from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 10 that the witness of the word to
their acceptance is sufficient, and that, if they
believe not this witness of God in His word,
they make Him a liar. Show them further
from <abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 13, that it is after we believe the
testimony of the word that we are “sealed
with the Holy Spirit of promise.” The natural
order in assurance is this: First, assurance
of our justification, <i>resting on the “Word of
God.”</i> Second, public confession of Christ,
“with the mouth<a id='tn060'></a>,” Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 10. Third,
the witness of the Holy Spirit. The trouble
with many is that they wish to invert this
order and have the witness of the Holy Spirit
before they confess Christ with the mouth.
From <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 32, 33, we learn that when we
confess Christ before men, then He confesses
us before the Father. We cannot reasonably
expect the witness of the Spirit from the Father
until we are confessed before the Father. So
confession of Christ logically precedes the
witness of the Spirit.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is very important in using these texts to
make clear what saving faith is; because many
may say that they believe when they do not, in
the sense of these texts, and so get a false assurance
and entertain false hopes and never
find deliverance. There is a great deal of careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>dealing with those who lack assurance.
Workers are so anxious to have inquirers come
out clearly that they urge them on to assurance
when they have no right to have assurance
of salvation as they have not really accepted
Christ.</p>

<p class='c023'>John <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12, and <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12, make very
clear what believing is—receiving Jesus or
committing to Jesus. Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 10, will serve
a similar purpose by showing that it “is <em>with
the heart</em> man believeth unto righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <i>Those who lack assurance because of
sin.</i> The trouble with those who lack assurance
is, often, that there is some sin or questionable
practice which they ought to confess
and give up. John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 12; <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 7; <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr>
<abbr title='28'>xxviii.</abbr> 13; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='32'>xxxii.</abbr> 1‒5, are useful passages
in dealing with this class of men, for they
show that it is when sin is confessed and
forsaken and we follow Christ, that we receive
pardon, light and assurance. Often times it
is well when one lacks assurance to put the
question squarely to him: “Do you know of
any sin on to which you are holding or anything
in your life which your conscience troubles
you about?”</p>

<p class='c019'><abbr title='2'>II.</abbr> <span class='sc'>Back–sliders.</span> There are two classes
of back–sliders and they should be dealt with
in different ways.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>1. <i>Careless back–sliders; those who have
no great desire to come back to the Saviour.</i>
With such persons use <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 5, drive the
question right home, “What iniquity have you
found in the Lord?” Show them the base
ingratitude and folly of forsaking such a
Saviour and Friend. Very likely they have
wandered away because of unkind treatment
by professed Christians, but hold them right
to the point of how <em>the Lord</em> treated them
and how they are now treating Him. Use
also <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 13, and show them what they
have forsaken and for what. Have them read
the verse and ask them, “is not that verse
true? When you forsook the Lord did you
not forsake the ‘fountain of living waters’ and
turn to ‘broken cisterns that can hold no
water?’” Illustrate the text by showing how
foolish it would be to turn from a fountain of
pure living water to broken cisterns or muddy
pools. God has greatly honored this verse
in bringing back–sliders back to himself. Use
<abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 19. When they have read it ask them
whether they have not found it “an evil thing
and bitter” having forsaken the Lord their
God. <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 14; 1 Kings <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 9, and Luke
<abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 13‒17, can often times be used with effect
with an impenitent back–slider, showing him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the result of his wandering. I have a friend
who always uses Amos. <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 11, 12, and often
times with good results.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <i>Back–sliders who are sick of their wanderings
and sin and desire to come back to
the Lord.</i> These are perhaps as easy a class
to deal with as we ever find. <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 12, 13,
and 22, will show them how ready the Lord
is to receive them back and that all he asks
of them is that they acknowledge their sin
and return to him. <abbr title='Hosea'>Hos.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 1‒4, is full of
tender invitation to penitent back–sliders and
also shows the way back to God. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='43'>xliii.</abbr> 22,
24, 25, and <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='44'>xliv.</abbr> 20‒22; <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 11‒13;
<abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 28‒31; <abbr title='Second Chronicles'>2 Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 14; <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr>
<abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 9; <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 1‒2, set forth God’s unfailing love for
the back–slider and His willingness to receive
him back. Mark <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 7; <abbr title='Second Chronicles'>2 Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 4;
<abbr title='33'>xxxiii.</abbr> 1‒9, 12, 13, give illustrations of great
back–sliders who returned to the Lord and how
lovingly He received them, <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 9; <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>iii.</abbr> 12‒13;
<abbr title='Second Chronicles'>2 Chron.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 12, 15; <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 14, show just
what steps the back–slider must take to come
back to the Lord and be restored to his favor,
viz: humble himself, confess his sins and turn
from his sin. Luke <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 11‒24, is perhaps the
most useful passage of all in dealing with a
<a id='tn064'></a>back–slider who wishes to return for it has both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the steps which the back–slider must take and
the kind of reception he will receive.</p>

<p class='c023'>When a back–slider has returned he should
always be given instructions as to how to live
so as not to back–slide again. The instruction
to be given will be found in <a id='tn064_2'></a><a href='#ch12s15'>Chapter <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> sec. 15</a>.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='8'>VIII.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH PROFESSED SKEPTICS AND INFIDELS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There are various classes of Sceptics and
the same methods of dealing will not answer
for all.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='ch08s1'></a>1. <i>Skeptics who are mere triflers.</i> With
such use <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18. If a man says the Bible
is foolishness to him, you can say “Yes, that
is just what the Bible itself says.” He will
probably be surprised at this reply and then
you can show him <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18; “the preaching
of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.”
Then you can say to him, “You see
that the Bible says that it is foolishness to
some—them that <em>perish</em>—and the reason it is
foolishness to you is because you are perishing.”
<abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 14, can be used in a similar
way. A worker was one night dealing with a
man who said to him when he was trying to
persuade him to come to Christ, “all that
you are saying is foolishness to me.” The
worker quickly replied, “Yes, that is just what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the Bible says.” The man looked at him in
astonishment and said: “What?” “You said all
that I have been saying to you was foolishness
to you, and that is just what the Bible says.”
The man was more astonished then than ever
and the worker turned him to <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 14, “But
the natural man receiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness
unto him; neither can he know them because
they are spiritually discerned.” The man
said “I never saw that before; I never thought
of it in that light before.” <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 3, 4, is
very useful in showing the trifler that he is
lost and that his skepticism arises from the
fact that the “god of this world hath blinded
his mind.” <abbr title='Second Thessalonians'>2 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 10‒12, is useful in
showing the origin of skepticism, “because
they received not the love of the truth” and
the consequences of skepticism—delusion and
damnation. John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 21, 24, is also very
searching in dealing with this class of skeptics,
showing the terrible consequences of unbelief.
John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 44; <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 18, 19, 20 expose the origin of
scepticism. <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 1, is useful in some
cases though one needs to be guarded in its
use, using it only when it can be done with
earnestness and tenderness. <abbr title='Second Thessalonians'>2 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 7, 8
can also be used with good results.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><a id='ch08s2'></a>2. <i>Serious minded skeptics.</i> There is a
large class of men and women in our day who
are really desirous of knowing the truth but
who are in an utter fog of skepticism. John
<abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 17 is a very helpful passage in dealing with
such. It shows the way out of skepticism to
faith. Get the skeptic to act along the line
of that verse. Put to him the question, “Will
you surrender your will to God and promise
to search honestly and earnestly to find out
what God’s will is that you may do it, to ask
God to show you whether you need a Saviour
and whether Jesus is a Divine Saviour, the
Son of God; and will you promise that, if
God will show you that Jesus is the Son of
God, to accept Him as your Saviour and confess
Him before the world?” Have him make
his promise definite, by putting it down in
black and white. If you get him to do this,
his skepticism will soon take wings.</p>

<p class='c023'>One evening at the close of a service
I asked a gentleman why he was not a
Christian. He replied: “I will tell you.
I do not talk much about it; for I am not
proud of it as some are, but I am a skeptic.
I have lain awake nights thinking about this
matter.” “Do you believe there is a God?”
“Yes, I never gave up my faith that there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>a God.” “Well, if there is a God you ought
to obey him. Will you to–night take your
stand upon the will of God to follow it wherever
it carries you even if it carries you over
the Niagara Falls?” “I try to do as near right
as I know how.” “That is not what I asked;
will you take your stand on the will of God
to follow it wherever it carries you?” “I
have never put it that way.” “Will you put
it that way to–night?” “I will.” “Do you
believe God answers prayer?” “I don’t know;
I am afraid not.” “You don’t know that he
does not?” “No.” “Well, here is a possible
clue to the truth, will you follow it, will you
ask God to show you whether Jesus is His
Son; and what your duty concerning him
is?” “I will.” Not long after that the
man came into a meeting with a new look in
his face. He arose and said: “I was all in a
mist. I believed nothing.” Then he told us
what he had done. He had done just as he
promised. “And now,” he continued, “my
doubts are all gone. I don’t know where they
have gone but they are gone.” If the skeptic
will not act in this way you can “stop his
mouth” by showing him that he is not an honest
skeptic and that the trouble with him is not
his skepticism but his sin. If the man does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>believe there is a God, you can begin one step
further back. Ask him if he believes there is
an absolute difference between right and wrong
(if he does not he is a mere trifler). If he says
he does, ask him if he will take his stand
upon the right and follow it wherever it
carries him. He may try to put you off by
saying “What is right?” or that he is doing the
right as nearly as he knows how. Get him to
promise that he will take his stand upon the
right, whatever he may find it to be and follow
it whatever the consequence may be.
Then show him that if he is honest in this
promise, he will try to find out what the right
is. Next say to him<a id='tn069'></a>, “You do not know
whether God answers prayer or not. I know
He does, and you will admit that here is
a possible clue to knowledge. If you are
honest in your desire to know the truth, you
will follow this possible clue. You can
get down and at least pray, ‘O my God, if
there be a God, teach me thy will and
I will do it. Show me whether Jesus is
thy son or not. If you show that he is, I
will accept Him as my Saviour and confess
Him before the world.<a id='tn069_2'></a>’” Then tell the man
to begin reading the Gospel of John, reading
slowly and <a id='tn069_3'></a>thoughtfully, only a few verses at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>a time, asking God for light each time before
reading and promising God that he will follow
the light as fast as He makes it clear. If the
man will follow this rational course, it will result
in every case in the skeptic coming out
into the clear light of faith in the Bible, as
the word of God, and Jesus Christ as the Son
of God. If the man is not an honest skeptic,
this course of treatment will reveal the fact
and then you can show him that the difficulty
is not with his skepticism but with his rebellious
heart.</p>

<p class='c023'>If the man says that he does not know
whether there is an absolute difference between
right and wrong, then you can set it
down at once that he is bad and turn upon
him kindly and earnestly and say to him,
“My friend, there is something wrong in
your life; no man that is living right doubts
that there is a difference between right and
wrong. Now you probably know what is
wrong and the trouble is not with your skepticism,
but with <a id='tn070'></a>your sin.” One afternoon
after I had given out an invitation for any
skeptic or any one else who wished to talk
with me, to remain after the meeting, a young
man with whom I had dealt some months before
stayed. I asked him what his trouble was.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>He replied, “The same trouble that I told you
in the spring, I cannot believe that there is
a God.” I asked him if he had done as I
had advised him to do in our former conversation;
if he had taken his stand upon the
right to follow it wherever it carried him. He
replied that he did not know that there was
any difference between right and wrong. “I do
not know that there is such a thing as right.”
I looked him right in the eyes and said, “Is
there some sin your life?”</p>

<p class='c023'>He said “Yes.” I said “what is it?” He replied,
“The same that I told you last spring.”
I said, “You promised to give it up, have you
given it up?” He said “No, I have not.” “Well,”
I said, “there is the difficulty, not with your
skepticism. Give up that sin and your skepticism
will take care of itself.” In some confusion
he replied, “I guess that is the trouble.”</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <i>Those who doubt the existence of God.</i></p>

<p class='c023'>The passages under 1 and 2 can also be
used with this class and generally it is wise to
use them before those given under this head.
There are however, three passages that are
often times effective with this specific
class of skeptics. <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 1; before using
this passage you can say to the man, “Let me
read you from God’s own word what he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>says about those who deny his existence.”
Often times it is well to leave the passage
to do its own work. Sometimes, however, it
is wise to dwell a little upon it. Call the
man’s attention to the fact that it is “in his
heart” that the fool says “there is no God.”
He does not believe there is a God because he
does not wish to. You can add that the folly
of saying in one’s heart that there is no God
is seen in two points; first, there is a God and
it is folly to say there is not one, and second,
the doctrine that there is not a God always
brings misery and wretchedness. Put it right
to the man, and ask him if he ever knew a
happy atheist. <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 1, 2; Romans <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 19‒22,
are also effective passages.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. <i>Those who doubt that the Bible is the
word of God.</i></p>

<p class='c023'>Romans <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 3, 4, is useful in showing that
questioning the fact does not alter the fact.
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 35, is often used by the Spirit to
carry to the heart of the skeptic the certainty
and immutability of God’s word. Mark <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr>
13; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 18; John <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 35; Luke <abbr title='10'>xxiv.</abbr> 27, 44,
are useful as giving Christ’s testimony that
the Old Testament is the Word of God. They
are especially helpful in dealing with those
who say that they accept the authority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Christ but not that of the Old Testament,
for in them Christ sets His seal to the Old
Testament Scriptures and they show conclusively
that if we accept His authority we
must accept that of the Old Testament also.
Along the same line John <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 26, and <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 12,
13, are useful as containing Christ’s indorsement
of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c023'><abbr title='First Thessalonians'>1 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 13, can be used with good effect
to meet the statement which is often made,
that Paul nowhere claims that his teaching
is the word of God. <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 21, John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr>
47; Luke <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 30, 31, can also be used in dealing
with this class. <abbr title='Second John'>2 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 10, is very
effective in showing the guilt of those who
believe not the record that God has given.
Before using this last passage you can say,
“You doubt, do you, that the Bible is the
Word of God? Now let us see what God says
about those that believe not His testimony;”
then turn them to the passage and have them
read it.</p>

<p class='c019'>5. <i>Those who doubt a future existence.</i></p>

<p class='c023'><abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 35‒36; <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 28‒29; <abbr title='Daniel'>Dan.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 2.</p>

<p class='c019'>6. <i>Those who doubt the doctrine of future
punishment, or the conscious, endless suffering
of the lost.</i> <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='21'>xxi.</abbr>  8, defines what
“death” means when used in the scriptures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='17'>xvii.</abbr> 8, compared with <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 20,
shows what perdition or destruction means in
the scriptures. <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 20, compared with
<abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 10 shows that “the lake of fire” is not
a place where those consigned to it cease to
exist, for we find in the latter passage the
beast and false prophet are still there at the
end of a thousand years and that they, so far
from being annihilated or losing conscious existence
are tormented night and day forever
and ever. <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 7‒8 show that those who
are subjected to the terrible retribution here
described are those whose names are not written
in the Book of Life. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28 shows
that there is destruction for the soul apart
from the destruction of the body. Luke
<abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 5, shows that after one is killed and is of
course dead, there is a punishment in “hell<a id='tn074'></a>.”
Mark <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 28‒29 (<abbr title='Revised Version'>R. V.</abbr>) shows that there is such
a thing as eternal sin. Luke <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 23‒26, shows
that the condition of the wicked dead is one
of conscious torment. Mark <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 21, shows
that the retribution visited upon the wicked
is of so stern a character that it would be
better for him upon whom it is visited if he
had never been born.</p>

<p class='c023'><abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 4; Jude 6, show that hell is
not a place where the inhabitants cease to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>exist, but where they are reserved alive, for
the purpose of God. <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28‒29, show
that while the punishment of transgression of
the Mosaic law was death, that sorer punishment
awaits those who have “trodden under
foot the Son of God.” <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='25'>xxv.</abbr> 41 gives
further light upon the subject. It shows that
the wicked go to the same place with the
Beast and False Prophet and the Devil mentioned
in <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 20, and <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 10, and share
the same endless, conscious torment.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='tn075'></a>7.  <i>Those who doubt the divinity of
Christ.</i></p>

<p class='c023'>a. In Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 36; <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 8, compare <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr>
<abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 8‒10; <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 8; John <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 28; <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>ix.</abbr> 5;
<abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 17, compare <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='44'>xliv.</abbr> 6, we find several
divine titles applied to Christ, the same titles
being applied to Christ in the New Testament
that are applied to Jehovah in the old.</p>

<p class='c023'>b. In <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 10, 3, we find divine offices
attributed to Christ.</p>

<p class='c023'>c. In John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 22‒23, compare <abbr title='Revelation'>Rev.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 13;
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 6; <abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 10, we find it taught that
Jesus Christ should be worshiped as God.</p>

<p class='c023'>d. In John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 22‒23 we find Jesus claiming
the same honor as his Father, and either He
was Divine or the most blasphemous impostor
that ever lived. Drive it home that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>one who denies Christ’s Divinity puts Him in
the place of a blasphemous imposter. Mark
<abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 61, 62, can be used in a similar way.</p>

<p class='c023'>e. <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 22, 23, compared with <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr>
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 1, 5, shows that the one who denies the
Divinity of Christ, no matter who he may be,
is a liar and an antichrist. <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 10‒12,
shows that he who does not believe that Jesus
is divine makes God a liar, “Because he believeth
not the record that God gave of His
Son.” <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28‒29, shows the folly, guilt
and punishment of rejecting Christ as the
Son of God. John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 24, shows beyond a
question that no one who does not believe in
the Divinity of Jesus Christ will be saved.
<abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 31, shows that we have life through
believing that Jesus is the Christ, the son of
God.</p>

<p class='c023'>(Note. It is best as a rule before taking up
specific difficulties to deal with the inquirer
with the passage under the head of “<a id='tn076'></a><a href='#ch08s1'>Skeptics who are triflers</a>,” or those under “<a href='#ch08s2'>Serious minded skeptics</a>.”)</p>

<p class='c023'>Often times there is no need to take up
specific questions as for example about future
punishment until the inquirer has first settled
the matter whether he will accept Christ as
his Saviour.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='9'>IX.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THE COMPLAINING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Those who complain of <a id='tn077'></a>God.</span></p>

<p class='c023'>Many that you wish to lead to Christ will
say something to the effect that God is unjust
and cruel, Job. <abbr title='40'>xl.</abbr> 2, and Romans <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 20,
are very pointed passages to use with inquirers
of this class and need no comment. It
might be well to preface the reading of the
passages with some remark like this; “Do
you know of how enormous a sin you are
guilty in accusing God of being unjust and
cruel? Let me read what God says about it
in His Word.” Then read the passages. Romans
<abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 33 will serve to show the complaining
that the reason God’s ways seem unjust
and cruel is because they are so deep and
unsearchable; and that the trouble is not with
God’s ways but the limitation of their understanding.
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 5, 7, 10, 11 are especially
useful in cases where the inquirer complains
because of his own misfortunes or sorrows. <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr>
<abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 8‒9 will often times prove helpful. Not infrequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>you will meet with one who will say
that “God is unjust to create men and then
damn them.” Turn such an one to <abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr>
<abbr title='33'>xxxiii.</abbr> 11. This passage meets this complaint
by showing that God has no pleasure in the
death of the wicked, but desires their welfare
and that the wicked bring damnation upon
themselves by their stubborn refusal to repent.
<abbr title='First Timothy'>1 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 3‒4, shows that God, so far from
creating man to damn him, desires that all
men be saved. <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 9, teaches that
God is not willing that any should perish and
is delaying His purposes in order that all may
come to repentance. John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 40, and <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='23'>xxiii.</abbr> 37, show that the whole cause of man’s
damnation is his own willful and persistent refusal
to come to Christ. John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36, and <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr>
16, are also helpful in many cases.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>Those who complain of the bible.</span>
Men will often times say, “The Bible is contradictory
and absurd;” or “the Bible seems
foolish to me.” Two classes of passages can
be used in dealing with such inquirers.</p>

<p class='c023'>a.  <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18; <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 14; <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>iv.</abbr> 3‒4; <abbr title='Daniel'>Dan.</abbr>
<abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 10; <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 33, 34 and in extreme cases
<abbr title='Second Thessalonians'>2 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 10, 11, 12.</p>

<p class='c023'>b.  <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 17; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='25'>xxv.</abbr> 14; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 25,
(see remarks under <a href='#ch08s2'>Serious Minded Skeptics</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and <a href='#ch08s1'>Skeptics who are Triflers</a>.) Sometimes the
best thing to do with a man who says the
Bible is full of contradictions, is to hand him
your Bible and ask him to show you one. In
most cases he will not attempt to do it; as
people who complain about the Bible, as a rule
know nothing about its contents. One day
a man was brought to me to deal with and
when I asked him why he was not a Christian
he replied, “The Bible is full of contradictions.”
I at once asked him to show me one.
“Oh!” he said, “it’s full of them.” I said, “If
it is full of them you ought to be able to show
me one.” He said, “Well, there is one in
Psalms.” I said, “Show it to me.” He commenced
looking in the back of the New Testament
for the book of Psalms. I said, “You
are not looking in the right part of the Bible
for Psalms. Let me find it for you.” I found
him the book of Psalms and handed it to him.
After fumbling around he said, “I could find
it, if I had my own Bible here.” “Well,” I
said, “Will you bring your Bible to–night?” He
promised he would and agreed to meet me at
a certain place in the church. The appointed
hour came, but he did not. Some months
afterwards in another series of meetings in
the same church one of the workers stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>me and said, “Here’s a man I wish you would
deal with; he is a skeptic.” I looked at him
and recognized him as the same man. “Oh!”
I said, “you are the man that lied to me here;”
and with much confusion he admitted that
he was, but he was still playing his old game
of saying that the Bible was full of contradictions.
In nine cases out of ten, men who
say this, know nothing about the Bible, and
when you ask them to show you a contradiction
in the Bible they are filled with confusion.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Those who complain of God’s way of
Salvation.</span></p>

<p class='c023'>A great many men will say, “I do not see
why God could not save men in some other
way than by the death of His son.” <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr>
8, 9, Romans <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 33 are useful in dealing with
such. I have used Romans <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 20 with effect
with men of this sort. A young student said to
me one night, when I asked why he was not a
Christian, that he did not see why it was necessary
for Christ to die for him; why God did
not save him in some other way. I opened
my Bible and read to him Romans <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 20,
and put the question right to him, “Who art
thou that repliest against God?” and then
said to him, “Do you realize what you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>doing, that you are condemning God?” The
young man very much confused said “I did
not mean to do that.” “Well,” I said; “that is
what you are doing.” “If that is so,” he replied,
“I will take it back.” A good way to
do with such men is to show them by the use
of passages given under the chapter “<a href='#ch03'>Dealing with the Indifferent</a>” that they are lost sinners.
When any one is led to see this, God’s
way of salvation will approve itself as just the
thing.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>Those who complain of Christians.</span>
Very frequently when we try to persuade men
to accept Christ as their Saviour, they reply;
“<i>There are too many hypocrites in church</i>.”
Romans <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 4 and 12, especially the latter
verse, are exceedingly effective in dealing with
such.</p>

<p class='c023'>Romans <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 1, and <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 1‒5, are also
excellent. <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='21'>xxi.</abbr> 21, 22 is useful in showing
the objector that he is solely responsible for
his own relation to Christ and that what others
do is none of his affairs. Sometimes the inquirer
will <i>complain of the way Christian
people have treated him</i>. In such a case turn
the attention of the inquirer from the way in
which Christian people have treated him to
the way in which God has treated him. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>this purpose use <abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 5; <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 5; Romans
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 6‒8. Then ask him if the fact that Christians
have treated him badly is any excuse for
his treatment of a Heavenly Father who has
treated him so well. One night turning to an
aged man I asked him if he was a Christian.
He replied that he was not, that he was a
back–slider. I asked him why he back–slid.
He replied that Christian people had treated
him badly. I opened my Bible and read
<abbr title='Jeremiah'>Jer.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 5, to him, “Thus saith the Lord, what
iniquity have your fathers found in <em>me</em>, that
they are gone far from <em>me</em>, and have walked
after vanity and are become vain?” I said,
“Did you find any iniquity in God? Did God
not use you well<a id='tn082'></a>?” With a good deal of feeling
the man admitted that God had not
treated him badly and I held him right to this
point of God’s treatment of him, and not
man’s treatment, and his treatment of God.
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr> 23‒35; <abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 30‒32; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr>
14‒15, are also useful as showing the absolute
necessity of our forgiving men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='10'>X.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO WISH TO PUT OFF A DECISION UNTIL SOME OTHER TIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'><a id='ch10s1'></a>1. There are several classes of those who
wish to put off a decision. One of the largest
is composed of <i>those who say “I want to
wait,” or “Not to–night<a id='tn083'></a>,” or “I will think about
it,” or “I will come to–morrow night</i>,” or some
such thing. Use <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 6. The inquirer having
read the passage, ask him when it is that
he is to seek the Lord, and when he answers
“While he may be found,” ask him when that
is and then drive it home. Ask him if he is
sure that he can find Him to–morrow if he
does not seek Him to–day. Or you can use
<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 1. It is well after he has read
this verse to ask the one with whom you are
dealing what becomes of the one who “being
often reproved hardeneth his neck” and when
he answers “He shall be destroyed,” ask him
how he shall be destroyed, and when he answers
“Suddenly,” ask him if he is willing to
run the risk. Or you can use <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='25'>xxv.</abbr> 10‒12.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Ask him who it was that went into the marriage?
and when he answers “They that were
ready” ask him if he is ready. Then ask him
what happened after those who were ready
went <a id='tn084'></a>in. Then ask him where “those who
were not ready” were. Then put it to him,
“Are you willing to be on the out–side?” Or you
can use Luke <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 19, 20. Ask the inquirer for
how long a time this man thought he had made
provision. Then ask him: “If God should
call you to–night would you be ready?” <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 44, is especially effective in dealing with
those who say “I am not ready.” 1 Kings <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr>
21, can be used with good effect. An excellent
way to use this verse is by asking the person
whether he would be willing to wait a
year and not have an opportunity under any
circumstances, no matter what came up, of
accepting Christ. When he answers, “No, I
might die within a year,” ask him if he would
be willing to wait a month. Then bring it
down to a week and finally to a day, and ask
him if he would like God and the Holy Spirit
and all Christians to leave him alone for a
day and he not have an opportunity, under any
circumstances of accepting Christ? Almost
any thoughtful person will say, “No.” Then
tell him that if that is the case he had better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>accept Christ at once. Dr. Chalmers was the
first one to use this method and it has been
followed by many others with great success.
<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='27'>xxvii.</abbr> 1; James <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 13, 14; Job. <abbr title='36'>xxxvi.</abbr> 18;
Luke <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 24‒28; <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 19, 20; John <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 21; <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 35;
<abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 33‒34, can also be used with this class.</p>

<p class='c019'>2.  Those who say “<i>I must get fixed in
business first, then I will become a Christian</i><a id='tn085'></a>,”
or “<a id='tn085_2'></a><i>I must do something else first.</i>” <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 33,
is the great passage to use in such cases; for it
shows that we must seek the kingdom of God
first.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. Those who say “<i>I am waiting God’s
time</i>.” If one says this, ask him if he will
accept Christ in God’s time if you will show
him when God’s time is. Then turn to <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr>
<abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 2, or <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 15.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. Those who say “<i>I am too young</i>,” <a id='tn085_3'></a>or “<i>I
want to wait until I am older</i>.” Ecc. <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 1, is
an <a id='tn085_4'></a>all–sufficient answer to such. <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 14,
and <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr> 3, are also good passages to use
as they show that youth is the best time to
come to Christ and that all must become
children, even if they are old, before they can
enter into the kingdom of Heaven. It is often
times wise in dealing with persons who wish
to put off a decision until some time in the
future to use the passages given for “<a href='#ch03'>The Indifferent</a>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>until such a deep impression is made
of their need of Christ that they will not be
willing to postpone accepting Christ.</p>

<p class='c023'>In dealing with those under “<a href='#ch10s1'>1</a>” above, it
is best to use only one passage and drive that
home by constant <a id='tn086'></a>repetition. One night I was
dealing with a man who was quite interested
but who kept <a id='tn086_2'></a>saying “I cannot decide to–night.”
I quoted <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 1. To every
answer he made I would come back to this
passage. I must have repeated it a great many
times in the course of the talk until the man
was made to feel not only his need of Christ
but the danger of delaying and the necessity
of a prompt decision. He tried to get away
from the passage but I held him to this one
point. The passage lingered with him and
it was emphasized by the providence of God;
for that very night he was assaulted and quite
seriously injured, and he came the next night
with his head bandaged and accepted Christ.
The pounding which he received from his assailant
would probably have done him little
good if the text of scripture had not been
pounded into his mind.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='11'>XI.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>DEALING WITH THE WILLFUL AND THE DELUDED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>The Willful</span></p>

<p class='c023'><a id='tn087'></a>There are several varieties of the Willful.
There are those for example who say
“<i>I do not wish you to talk to me</i>.” In such a
case it is usually best to give some pointed
passage of scripture and let it talk for itself
and then leave the person alone to reflect
upon it. Romans <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 23; <abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 28, 29;
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 25; Mark <abbr title='16'>xvi.</abbr> 16; <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 1, and
<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 24‒33, are passages which are good for
this purpose.</p>

<p class='c023'>Then there are those who say “<i>I cannot forgive</i>.”
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='6'>vi.</abbr> 15 and <abbr title='18'>xviii.</abbr> 23‒35, are good
to use as showing that they must forgive or be
lost. <abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 13, and <abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr> <abbr title='36'>xxxvi.</abbr> 26, will
show them how they can forgive. There are
a great many people who are kept from
Christ by an <em>unforgiving</em> spirit. Some
times this difficulty can be removed by getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the person to kneel in prayer and ask God
to take away their unforgiving spirit. I once
reasoned a long time with an inquirer who
was under deep conviction, but was held back
from accepting Christ by a hatred in her heart
toward some one who had wronged her. She
kept insisting that she could not forgive.
Finally I said, “let us get down and tell God
about this matter.” To this she consented
and scarcely had we knelt when she burst into
a flood of tears, and the difficulty was removed
and she accepted Christ immediately.</p>

<p class='c023'>There are those again who say “<i>I love the
world too much</i>.” Mark <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 36, is the great
text to use with this class. Luke <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 33, will
show the absolute necessity that the world be
given up. Luke <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 16‒20; <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 15, 16,
17, will show the folly of holding on to the
world and <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='84'>lxxxiv.</abbr> 11, Romans <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 32, will
show that the Lord will hold back no good
thing from them.</p>

<p class='c023'>There are those who say “<i>I cannot acknowledge
a wrong that I have done</i>.” <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='28'>xxviii.</abbr>
13, will show the wretchedness and woe that
is sure to follow unless the wrong is acknowledged.
Others will say “<i>I do not want to make
a public confession</i>.” Romans <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 10; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr>
32, 33, will show that God will accept nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>else. Mark <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 38; <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 42, 43, and <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr>
<abbr title='29'>xxix.</abbr> 25, will show the peril of not making it.
There are those who say “<i>I want to have my
own way</i>.” <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 8‒9, will show how much
better God’s way is, and <abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 12, shows
the consequences of having our own way.
Finally there are those who say “<i>I neither
accept Christ nor reject Him</i>.” <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 30,
will show that they must do one or the other.
This verse has been used to the conviction of a
great many.</p>

<p class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The Deluded</span></p>

<p class='c023'><i>a.</i> Under this head come the <i>Roman
Catholics</i>. A good way to deal with a Roman
Catholic is to show him the necessity of the
new birth and what the new birth is. <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr>
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 3, 5, 7, shows the necessity of the new birth.
What the new birth is, is shown in <abbr title='Ezekiel'>Ezek.</abbr>
<abbr title='36'>xxxvi.</abbr> 25‒27; <abbr title='Second Corinthians'>2 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 17; <abbr title='Second Peter'>2 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 4.
Many Roman Catholics understand the new
birth to mean baptism, but it can be easily
shown them that the language used does not
fit baptism. Further than this, in <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr>
<abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 15, Paul says to the Corinthian Christians
he had begotten them again through the gospel.
If the new birth meant baptism he must
have baptized them, but in <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 14, he
declares he had not baptized them. Acts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 13, 21, 23, shows that a man may be
baptized, and yet his heart not be “right in
the sight of God” so he has “neither part
nor lot in this matter.” It is well to take a
step further and show the inquirer what the
evidences of the new birth are. <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 29;
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 9, 14‒17; <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 1, 4, give the Biblical evidences
of the new birth. The next question that
will arise is “How to be born again.” This
question is answered in <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 12; <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 23;
<abbr title='James'>Jas.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 18.</p>

<p class='c023'>Acts <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 19, is a good text to use with Roman
Catholics as it shows the necessity of <a id='tn090'></a>repentance
and conversion. What repentance is,
will be shown by <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='55'>lv.</abbr> 7; Jonah <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 10. Still
another way of dealing with Roman Catholics
is by showing them that it is the believer’s
privilege to know that he has eternal life. Roman
Catholics almost always lack assurance.
They do not know that they are forgiven, but
hope to be forgiven some day. If you can
show them that we may <em>know</em> that we are
forgiven and that we have eternal life, it will
awaken in a great many of them a desire for
this assurance. <abbr title='First John'>1 John</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 13, shows that it
is the believer’s privilege to know. Acts <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr>
38, 39; <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 43, John <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 36, are very useful in leading
them into this assurance. Still another way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of dealing with them (but it is not best to use
it until you have already made some progress
with them) is to show them the advantage of
Bible study. Good texts for this purpose are
John <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 39; <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 1, 2; <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>iii.</abbr> 13‒17;
Jas <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 21, 22; <abbr title='Psalms'>Ps.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 1, 2; <abbr title='Joshua'>Josh.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 8; Mark <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 7,
8, 13; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 29. These texts, excepting
the one in <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Peter</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 1, 2, are all practically
the same in the “Douay” or Roman Catholic
Bible as they are in the Protestant Bible and
it is well oftentimes in dealing with a Catholic
to use the Catholic Bible.</p>

<p class='c023'>Still another way of dealing with a Roman
Catholic is to use the same method that you
would in dealing with an impenitent sinner—that
is to awaken a sense that he is a sinner
and needs Christ. For this purpose use <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr>
<abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 37, 38; <abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 10, 13; <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr> 6.</p>

<p class='c023'>Many people think that there is no use of
talking with Roman Catholics, that they cannot
be brought to Christ. This is a great mistake.
Many of them are longing for something
they do not find in the Roman Catholic
church, and, if you can show them from the
word of God how to find it, they come along
very easily and they make very earnest Christians.
Do not attack the Roman Catholic
church. Give them the truth, and the errors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>in time will take care of themselves. Often
times our attacks only expose our ignorance.</p>

<p class='c023'>There is one point at which we always have
the advantage in dealing with a Roman Catholic;
that is that there is peace and power in
Christianity as we know it that there is not
in Christianity as they know it, and they appreciate
the difference.</p>

<p class='c019'><i>b.</i> <i>Jews.</i>  The best way to deal with a Jew is to show
him that his own Bible points to Christ. The
most helpful passages to use are <abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='53'>liii.</abbr>;
<abbr title='Daniel'>Dan.</abbr> <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 26; <abbr title='Zechariah'>Zech.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 10. There are also
useful passages in the New Testament; the
whole book of Hebrews, especially the ninth
and tenth chapters and the seventh chapter,
25th to 28th verses, and the whole Gospel
of Matthew. A great many Jews to–day are
inquiring into the claims of Jesus of Nazareth,
and are open to approach upon this subject.
The great difficulty in the way of the Jew
coming out as a Christian is the terrific persecution
which he must endure if he does. This
difficulty can be met by the passages already
given under the head of “<a href='#ch05s5'>Those Who are Afraid of Persecution</a>.”</p>

<p class='c023'>(Note. There are a number of good tracts
for Jews which can be had from the Mildmay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Mission to the Jews, 79 Mildmay Road, London.)</p>

<p class='c019'><i>c.</i> <i>Spiritualists.</i> <abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 31; <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 6; <abbr title='Deuteronomy'>Deut.</abbr>

9‒12, are passages to be used with this class.</p>

<p class='c023'>In dealing with all classes of deluded people
it is well to begin by using <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 17, and
bring them to a place where they heartily desire
to know the truth. There is no hope of
bringing a man out of his delusion, unless he
desires to know the truth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='12'>XII.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>SOME HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There are a few general suggestions to be
made that will prove helpful to the worker.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <i>As a rule choose persons to deal with
of your own sex and about your own age.</i>
There are exceptions to this rule. One should
be always looking to the Holy Spirit for his
guidance as to whom to approach, and He may
lead us to one of the opposite sex, but unless
there is clear guidance in the matter, it is
quite commonly agreed among those who have
had large experience in Christian work that
men do, on the whole, most satisfactory work
with men, and women with women. Especially
is this true of the young. Many unfortunate
complications oftentimes arise when young
men try to lead young women to Christ or vice
versa. Of course, an elderly motherly woman
may do excellent work with a young man or
boy, and an elderly, fatherly man may do good
work with a young woman or girl. It is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>wise ordinarily for a young and inexperienced
person to approach one very much older and
maturer and wiser than themselves on this
subject.</p>

<p class='c019'>2.  <i>Whenever it is possible, get the person
with whom you are dealing alone.</i> No one
likes to open his heart freely to another on
this most personal and sacred of all subjects
when there are others present.  Many will
from pride defend themselves in a false position
when several are present, who would
fully admit their error or sin or need, if they
were alone with you. As a rule it is far better
for a single worker to deal with a single
unconverted person, than for several workers
to deal with a single inquirer or for a single
worker to deal with several inquirers at once.
If you have several to deal with take them one
by one.  Workers often find that when they
have made no headway while talking to several
at once, by taking individuals off by themselves
they soon succeed in leading them one
by one to Christ.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <i> Let your reliance be wholly in the Spirit
of God and the Word of God.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>4. <i> Do not content yourself with merely
reading passages from the Bible—much less in
merely quoting them, but have the one with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>whom you are dealing read them himself that
the truth may find entrance into the heart
through the eye <a id='tn096'></a>as well as the ear.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>5. <i>It is ofttimes well to use but a single
passage of scripture, drive that home and
clinch it</i> so that the one with whom you have
been dealing cannot forget it, but will hear it
ringing in his memory long after you have
ceased talking. Dr. Ichabod Spencer once in
dealing with a young man who had many difficulties
kept continually quoting the passage
“now is the accepted time, behold now is the
day of salvation.” The young man tried to get
Dr. Spencer on to something else, but over and
over again he rang out the words. The next
day the young man returned rejoicing in
Christ and thanking the doctor that he had
“hammered” him with that text. The words
kept ringing in his ears during the night and
he could not rest until he had settled the matter
by accepting Christ. It is a good thing when
a person can point to some definite verse in
the word of God and say “I know on the
authority of that verse that my sins are forgiven
and I am a child of God.” There are
times, however when a powerful effect is produced
by a piling up of passages along some
line until the mind is convinced and the heart
conquered.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>6.  <i>Always hold the person with whom you
are dealing to the main point of accepting
Christ.</i> If he wishes to discuss the claims of
various denominations, or the question of baptism,
or theories of future punishment or any
other question other than the central one of
his need of a Saviour and Christ the Saviour he
needs; tell him that those questions are proper
to take up in their right place and time,
but the time to settle them is after he has
settled the first and fundamental question of
accepting or rejecting Christ. Many a case has
been lost by an inexperienced worker allowing
himself to be involved in a discussion of some
side issue which it is utter folly to discuss
with an unregenerated person.</p>

<p class='c019'>7.  <i>Be courteous.</i>  Many well–meaning but
indiscreet Christians by their rudeness and impertinence
repel those whom they would win
to Christ. It is quite possible to be at once
perfectly frank and perfectly courteous. You
can point out to men their awful sin and need
without insulting them. Your words may be
very searching, while your manner is very
gentle and winning.  Indeed, the more
gentle and winning our manner is, the deeper
our words will go, for they will not stir up
the opposition of those with whom we deal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Some zealous workers approach those with
whom they wish to deal in such a manner
that the latter at once assume the defensive
and clothe themselves with an armor that
it is impossible to penetrate.</p>

<p class='c019'>8.  <i>Be dead in earnest.</i> Only the earnest
man can make the unsaved man feel the truth
of God’s word. It is well to let the passages
that we would use with others first sink into
our own souls. I know of a very successful
worker who for a long time used the one passage,
“prepare to meet thy God,” with every
one with whom she dealt, but that passage had
taken such complete possession of her heart
and mind that she used it with tremendous
effect. A few passages that have mastered us
are better than many passages that we have
mastered from some text book.</p>

<p class='c023'>The reader of this book is advised to ponder,
upon his knees, such of the passages suggested
in it as he decides to use until he
himself feels their power. We read of
Paul that he “ceased not to warn every one
night and day, with tears.” (Acts <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 31.)
Genuine earnestness will go farther than any
skill learned in a training class or from the
study of such a book as this.</p>

<p class='c019'>9. <i>Never lose your temper when trying to</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><i>lead a soul to Christ.</i> Some persons are
purposely exasperating, but even such may be
won, by patience, forbearance and gentleness.</p>

<p class='c023'>They certainly cannot be won if you lose
your temper. Nothing delights them more,
or gives them more comfort in their sins.
The more extremely irritating they are in
their words and actions the more impressed
they will be if you return insults with kindness.
Often times the one who has been
most insufferable will come back in penitence.
One of the most insulting men I ever met
afterwards became one of the most patient,
persistent and effective of workers.</p>

<p class='c019'>10.  <i>Never have a heated argument with
one whom you would lead to Christ.</i> This
always comes from the flesh and not from the
spirit.  (<abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 20, 22, 23.) It arises from
pride and unwillingness to let the other person
get the best of you in argument. Refuse to
argue. If the one with whom you are talking
has mistaken notions that must be removed
before he can be led to Christ quietly and
pleasantly show him their error. If the error
is not essential refuse to discuss it and hold the
person to the main question.</p>

<p class='c019'>11.  <i>Never interrupt any one else who is
dealing with a soul.</i> You may think he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>not doing it in the wisest way, but if you can
do it any better, bide your time and you will
have the opportunity. Many an unskilled
worker has had some one at the very point of
decision when some meddler has broken in and
upset the whole work. On the other hand,
do not let others, if you can help it, interrupt
you. Just a little word plainly but courteously
spoken will usually prevent it.</p>

<p class='c019'>12. <i>Don’t be in a hurry.</i> One of the
great faults of Christian work to–day is haste.
We are too anxious for immediate results and
so do superficial work. It is very noticeable
how many of those with whom Christ dealt
came out slowly. Nicodemus, Joseph, Peter
and even Paul—though the final step in his
case seems very sudden—are cases in point.
It was three days even after the personal appearance
of Jesus to Paul on the way to Damascus
before the latter came out into the
light and openly confessed Christ. (Acts <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr>
16.) One man with whom slow but thorough
work has been done, and who at last has been
brought out clearly for Christ, is better than
a dozen with whom hasty work has been done,
who think they have accepted Christ when
in reality they have not. It is often a wise
policy to plant a truth in a man’s heart and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>leave it to work. The seed on rocky ground
springs up quickly but withers as quickly.</p>

<p class='c019'>13. <i>Whenever it is possible and wise, get
the person with whom you are dealing on his
knees before God.</i> It is wonderful how many
difficulties disappear in prayer, and how readily
stubborn people yield when they are brought
into the very presence of God himself. I remember
talking with a young woman, in an inquiry
room, for perhaps two hours and making
no apparent headway; but, when at last we
knelt in prayer, in less than five minutes she
was rejoicing in her Saviour.</p>

<p class='c019'>14. <i>Whenever you seem to fail in any given
case go home and pray over it and study it to
see why you failed.</i> If you have been at a loss
as to what scripture to use, study that portion
of this book that describes the different classes
we meet and how to deal with them and see
where this case belongs and how you ought to
have treated it. Then go back if you can and
try again. In any case you will be better
prepared next time. The greatest success
in this work comes through many apparent
defeats. It will be well to frequently study
these hints and suggestions to see if your failures
come through neglect of them.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='ch12s15'></a>15. <i>Before parting from the one who has</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span><i>accepted Christ, be sure to give him definite
instructions as to how to succeed in the
Christian life.</i> The following are points that
should be always insisted upon. (a.) Confess
Christ with the mouth before men every opportunity
you get. <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 9, 10; <abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr>
32, 33. (b.) Be baptized and partake regularly
of the Lord’s supper. Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 38, 42; Luke
<abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 19; <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 24‒26. (c.) Study the Word
of God daily. <abbr title='First Peter'>1 Pet.</abbr> <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 2; Acts <abbr title='20'>xx.</abbr> 32; <abbr title='Second Timothy'>2 Tim.</abbr>
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 13‒17; Acts <abbr title='17'>xvii.</abbr> 11. (d.) Pray daily, often
and in every time of temptation. Luke <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr>
9‒13; <abbr title='22'>xxii.</abbr> 40; <abbr title='First Thessalonians'>1 Thes.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 17. (e.) Put away
out of your life every sin, even the smallest,
and everything you have doubts about, and
obey every word of Christ <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 6, 7; <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr>
<abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 23; <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 23. (f.) Seek the society of
Christians. <abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 12‒16; Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 42, 47;
<abbr title='Hebrews'>Heb.</abbr> <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 24, 25. (g.) Go to work for Christ.
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr> <abbr title='25'>xxv.</abbr> 14‒29. (h.) When you fall into
sin don’t be discouraged, but confess it at
once, believe it is forgiven because God says
so and get up and go on. <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 9; <abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr>
<abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 13‒14. It would be well to give these instructions
in some permanent form to the one
whom you have led to Christ. You can write
them out or get a little tract called the “Christian
Life Card” published by <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr> C. Collins,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Bureau of Supplies, New Haven, Conn. This
contains them and some other matter.</p>

<p class='c019'>16. <i>When you have led any one to Christ,
follow him up and help him in the development
of his Christian life.</i> Many are led to
Christ and then neglected and get on very
poorly. This is a great mistake. The work
of following up those who are converted is as
important as the work of leading them to
Christ, and as a rule no one can do it so well
as the person whom God used in their conversion.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c018'>CHAPTER <abbr title='13'>XIII.</abbr> <br /> <br /> <span class='c022'>THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c019'>There is one condition of success in bringing
men to Christ that is of such cardinal importance,
and so little understood, that it demands
a separate chapter. I refer to the
Baptism of the Holy Spirit. In Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 5; Luke
<abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 49 (comp. Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 8), and Acts <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 4, we
have three expressions; “baptized with the
Holy Spirit<a id='tn104'></a>,” “endured with power from on
high” and “filled with the Holy Spirit<a id='tn104_2'></a>.” By a
careful comparison of these and related passages
we will find that these various expressions
refer to one and the same experience.
This experience we shall see as we proceed in
the study of this subject is an absolutely necessary
condition of acceptable and effective
service for Christ.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>What is the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit?</span></p>

<p class='c023'>1. <i>It is a definite and distinct operation of
the Holy Spirit of which one may know
whether it has been wrought in him or not.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>This is evident from the fact that Jesus bade
His disciples tarry in Jerusalem until they
had received this enduement, (Luke <abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 49,
comp. Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 8), and if it was not a definite and
distinct operation of which they might know
whether they had received it or not, of course,
they would not know when this command of
Christ had been complied with and when they
were ready to begin their witnessing.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='ch13s1_2'></a>2. <i>It is an operation of The Holy Spirit
separate from His regenerating work.</i> This
appears from Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 5, where the disciples are
told “ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Spirit not many days hence.” But from <abbr title='John'>Jno.</abbr>
<abbr title='15'>xv.</abbr> 3; <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 10 we learn that the disciples were
already regenerated. It appears also from
Acts <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 15, 16 where we are told of certain
who had already believed and were baptized
with water, but upon whom the
Holy Spirit had not yet fallen. The same
thing is shown by Acts <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 1‒6, where
we are told of certain who were disciples,
but who had not received the Holy Spirit
since they believed. <em>One may then be regenerated
by the Holy Spirit without being
baptized with the Holy Spirit. Such an one
is saved but he is not yet fitted for service.</em>
Every believer has the Holy Spirit, <abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>9, but not every believer has the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit, (Acts <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 12‒16; <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 1‒2). We
shall see very soon that every believer may
have the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c019'>3. <i>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is always
connected with testimony or service</i>, (see
<abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 4‒13; Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 5‒8; Luke <abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 49;
Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 4; <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 8, 31; <abbr title='7'>vii.</abbr> 55; <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 17, 20; <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 45‒46;
<abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 6.) The Baptism of the Holy Spirit has
no direct reference to cleansing from sin.
This is an important point to bear in mind
for many reasons. There is a line of teaching
on this subject that leads men to expect
that if they receive the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit, the old carnal nature will be eradicated.
There is not a line of scripture to support this
position. As said above, and as any one can
learn for himself if he will examine all the
passages in which the baptism of the Holy
Spirit is mentioned, it is always connected
with testimony and service. It is indeed accompanied
with a great moral and spiritual uplifting
and pre–supposes, as we shall see, an entire
surrender of the will to Christ, but its primary
and immediate purpose is fitting for service.
We will get a more definite idea of what
the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is, if we consider
its manifestations and results as stated in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Bible. (a.) Let us look first at the passage that
goes most into detail on this subject, <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr>
<abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 4‒13. We see at once that <em>the manifestations
or results of the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit are not precisely the same in all persons</em>.
For example, the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit will not make every one who receives
it a successful evangelist or teacher. Some
quite different gift may be imparted. This
fact is often overlooked and much disappointment
and doubt are the result. The
manifestations or results vary with the lines
of service to which God has called different
individuals. One receives the gift of an evangelist,
another of a teacher, another of government,
another of a helper, another of a mother,
(<abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 28‒31; <abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr> <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 8, 11.) (b.) <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr>
<abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 7, 11. <em>There will be some gift in every
case.</em> Not the same gift but some gift, of an
evangelist, or a pastor, or of a teacher or some
other. (c.) <abbr title='First Corinthians'>1 Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 11. <em>The Holy Spirit is
Himself the one who decides what the gift or
gifts shall be which he will impart to each
individual.</em> It is not for us to select some
place of service and then ask the Holy Spirit
to qualify us for that service, nor for us to
select some gift, and then ask the Spirit to
impart to us that gift. It is for us to put ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>entirely at the disposal of the Holy
Spirit to send us where “He will,” into what
line of service “He will” (Acts <abbr title='13'>xiii.</abbr> 2,) and to
impart what gift “He will.” He is absolutely
sovereign and our rightful position is that of
absolute and unconditional surrender to Him.
This is where many fail of a blessing and
meet with disappointment. I know a most
sincere and self–sacrificing man who gave up
a lucrative business and took up the work of
an evangelist. He had heard of the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit; and had been led to suppose
that, if he received it, it would qualify
him for the work of an evangelist. The man
came more than four thousand miles to this
country, but the work did not open to him.
He was in much perplexity and doubt until he
was led to see that it was not for him to select
the work of an evangelist, as good as that
work was, and then expect the Holy Spirit
to qualify him for this self–chosen work. He
gave himself up to be sent into whatever work
the Spirit might will. Into the work in which
he was sent the power of the Spirit came
upon him and he received this very gift of an
evangelist which he had coveted. (d.) Acts
<abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 5, 8. <em>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit always
imparts power for service, the services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to which God calls us.</em> In a certain city was
an uneducated boy who was led to Christ.
In his very lowly occupation he began witnessing
for Jesus. He went on from step to
step in Christ’s work. My attention was
called to him by a gentleman who was interested
in him, and who said he would like to
have me meet him. The gentleman brought
him to Chicago, and I invited him one night
to speak in one of our tents. It was in an
exceedingly hard neighborhood. Into the
same tent an organized mob once came to
break up the meeting. It was a difficult audience
to hold. The young man began in
what appeared to me to be a very commonplace
way, and I was afraid I had made a mistake
in asking him to speak, but I prayed and
watched the audience. There was nothing
remarkable in his address as he went on—excepting
the bad grammar. But I noticed that
all the people were listening. They continued
to listen to the end. When I asked if there
was any one who wished to accept Christ,
people rose in different parts of the tent to
signify that they did. Thinking it all over, I
told the facts to a man who had known the
speaker before. “It is just so wherever he
goes” was the reply. What was the explanation?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>This uneducated boy had received
the Baptism of the Holy Ghost and had received
power. One night at the close of an
address on the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, a
minister came to me on the platform and said:
“I need this power, won’t you pray for me?”
“Let us kneel right down here now,” I replied,
and we did. A few weeks after I met a gentleman
who had been standing by. “Do you
remember,” he said “the minister with whom
you prayed at New Britain. He went back
to his church; his church is packed Sunday
evenings, a large part of the audience are
young men and he is having conversions right
along.” He had received the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit and “power.” (e.) Acts <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 29‒31. <em>The
Baptism of the Holy Spirit always imparts
boldness in testimony and service.</em> Peter is
a notable example of this. Contrast Peter in
Acts <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 8‒12 with Peter in Mark <abbr title='14'>xiv.</abbr> 66‒72.
Perhaps some one who reads this book has a
great desire to speak to others and win them
to Christ, but an insuperable timidity stands
in the way. If you will only get the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit, all that will be overcome.</p>

<p class='c023'>We are now in a position to define the
baptism of the Holy Spirit. <i>The Baptism of
the Holy Spirit, is the Spirit of God falling upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the believer, taking possession of his faculties,
imparting to him gifts not naturally his
own, but which qualify him for the service
to which God has called him.</i></p>

<p class='c019'>2. <span class='sc'>The necessity of the baptism of the
Holy Spirit as a preparation for Christian
work.</span></p>

<p class='c023'>(1.) <i>In Luke <abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr> 49. Jesus bade the apostles
to tarry in Jerusalem until they were “endued
with power from on high.”</i> These men
had been appointed to be witnesses of the life,
death and resurrection of Christ. (Luke <abbr title='24'>xxiv.</abbr>
45‒48. Acts; <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 22; <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 39‒41.) They had received
what would seem to be a splendid and
sufficient training for this work. For more
than three years they had been to school to
the best of teachers, Jesus Himself. They had
been eye witnesses of his miracles, death,
burial, resurrection and ascension. But there
was still one thing needed. And this need was of
such vital importance that Jesus would not permit
them to enter upon their appointed work
until that need had been met. That need was
the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. If the apostles
with their unparalleled fitting for service,
were not permitted to enter that service until
all their other training had been supplemented
by the Baptism of the Holy Spirit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>what daring presumption it is for any of us with
our inferior training to dare to do it. But this
is not all, <em>even Jesus Himself did not enter
upon his ministry until specially anointed with
the Holy Spirit and with power</em>. (Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 38,
comp. Luke <abbr title='3'>iii.</abbr> 22 and <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 1, 14). <em>This baptism is
an absolutely essential preparation for Christian
work.</em> It is either ignorance of the plain
requirements of God’s word or the most daring
presumption on our part when we try to do
work for Christ until we know we have been
Baptized with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class='c019'>(2.) <i>It is the privilege of every believer to be
baptized with the Holy Spirit.</i> This appears
from Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 39, <abbr title='Revised Version'>R. V.</abbr> “To you is the promise
and to your children and to all that are afar
off, even as many as the Lord our God shall
call unto him.” The context, the use of the
word “promise” in this and the preceding
chapter (ch. <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 4; <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 16, 33.) and the use of the
expression “gift of the Holy Spirit” throughout
the book, all prove conclusively that “the
promise” of this verse means the promise of
the Baptism of the Holy Spirit; and the verse
tells us that this promise is for all in all ages
of the church’s history whom God shall call
unto him, <a id='tn112'></a><i>i. e.</i> for every believer. If we
have not this baptism it is our own fault.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>It is for us and we are responsible before God
for all the work we might have done, and all
the souls we might have won if we were so
baptized, and we are guilty to the extent that
the work is not done and the souls not won.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='tn113'></a>3. <span class='sc'>How can we obtain the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit<a id='tn113_2'></a>?</span></p>

<p class='c023'>We now come to the practical question: how
can we obtain this Baptism of the Holy Spirit
which is such an absolute necessity in our
work for Christ? Fortunately the answer to
this question is very plainly stated in the Bible.</p>

<p class='c019'>(1) “Repent ye and be baptized every one of
you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission
of your sins; and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Spirit<a id='tn113_3'></a>” (Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 38 <abbr title='Revised Version'>R. V.</abbr>)
<em>The first step toward obtaining this Baptism
is repentance.</em> Repentance means “a change of
mind,” a change of mind about sin, about
God, and in this case especially (as the context
shows) a change of mind about Christ. A real
change of mind such as leads to action—to our
turning away from all sin, our turning to God,
our turning away from rejecting Jesus Christ
to accepting Him. <em>The second step is the confession
of our renunciation of sin and acceptance
of Jesus Christ in God’s appointed way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>by baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.</em> The
Baptism with the Holy Spirit in at least one instance
(Acts <abbr title='10'>x.</abbr> 44‒48) preceded the baptism with
water but this was manifestly an exceptional
case and God says “repent ye and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,” (Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr>
38, <abbr title='Revised Version'>R. V.</abbr>)</p>

<p class='c019'>(2) “The Holy Spirit whom God hath given
to them that obey him<a id='tn114'></a>.” (Acts <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 32). <em>The condition
of the gift of the Holy Ghost here stated
is that we “obey Him.”</em> Obedience means more
than the mere performance of some of the
things that God bids us do. It means the
entire surrender of our wills, ourselves and all
we have, to Him. It means that we come to
Him and say from the heart, “here I am, I am
thine, thou hast bought me with a price, I acknowledge
thine ownership. Take me, do with
me what thou wilt, send me where thou wilt,
use me as Thou wilt.” This entire yielding
of ourselves to God is the condition of our receiving
the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and it
is at this point that many fail of this blessing.
At the close of a convention a gentleman
hurried to the platform and said there was a
lady in great distress who wished to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>with me. It was an hour before I could get
to her, but I found her still in great mental
suffering in the intensity of her desire for the
Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Others had talked
to her but it had seemed to do no good.
I sat down behind her and said<a id='tn115'></a>, “Is your will
wholly surrendered?” She did not know. “You
wish to be a Christian worker do you not?”
“Yes.” “Are you willing to go back to Baltimore
and be a servant girl if it is God’s will?”
“No!” “You will never receive this blessing
until your own will is wholly laid down.” “I
can’t lay it down<a id='tn115_2'></a>.” “Would you like to have
God lay it down for you<a id='tn115_3'></a>?” “Yes.” “Well, let
us ask Him to do it.” We did, he heard the
prayer, the will was laid down, the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit was received and she went
from the church rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c023'>Obedience means also the doing in all matters
great and small, the will of God as revealed
in His Word or by His Spirit. Any refusal
to do what God bids us do, any conscious
doing of what he bids us not do, even
in very little matters, is sufficient to shut us
out of this blessing. If there is anything no
matter how little, that comes up before us to
trouble us as we pray over this matter, we
should set it right with God at once. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Finney tells of one who, in great agony prayed
for days for the Baptism of the Holy Spirit
but received no answer. At last as she was
praying one night she put her hand to her
head and took off some little adornment that
always came up before her when she prayed
and cast it from her. Immediately she received
the long desired blessing. It seemed
a very little thing but it was a matter of controversy
with God and hindered the blessing.</p>

<p class='c019'>(3.) “How much more shall your Heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask
Him.” (Luke <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 13.)</p>

<p class='c023'><a id='tn116'></a>(a.) There must be
definite prayer for this Baptism. It is often
said that the Holy Spirit is already here and
that every believer has the Spirit and so we
ought not to pray for the Holy Spirit. This
argument overlooks the distinction between
having the Holy Spirit and having this specific
operation of the Holy Spirit. (see <a href='#ch13s1_2'>1. 2.</a>) It
also contradicts the plain teaching of God’s
word that He gives “the Holy Spirit to them
that ask Him.” It is furthermore shown to be
fallacious by the fact that the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit in the book of Acts was constantly
given in connection with and in answer to
prayer. (Acts <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 14; <abbr title='1'>ii.</abbr> 1‒4; <abbr title='1'>iv.</abbr> 31; <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 15,17.)</p>

<p class='c023'>(b.) Prayer implies desire. There is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>real prayer for the Baptism of the Spirit unless
there is <em>a deep desire for it</em>. As long as a
man thinks he can get along somehow without
this blessing, he is not likely to get it; but
when a man reaches the place where he feels
he must have this no matter what it costs,
he is far on the way toward receiving it.
Many a minister of the gospel and other worker
has been brought to a place where he has
felt he could not go on with his ministry without
this gift and then the gift has soon followed
and the character of his work has been
entirely transformed.</p>

<p class='c023'>(c.) <i>The prayer to be effectual must be in
faith (Mark <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 24<a id='tn117'></a>).</i> James says in regard to
the prayer for wisdom<a id='tn117_2'></a>, “Let him ask in faith,
nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is
like a wave of sea driven with the wind and
tossed. For let not that man think that he
shall receive anything of the Lord.” (<abbr title='James'>Jas.</abbr> <abbr title='1'>i.</abbr> 6, 7.)
The same principle, of course, holds in regard
to the prayer for the Holy Spirit. It is
at this very point that many miss the blessing.
How to approach God in faith is clearly
taught by <abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 14, 15. “This is the confidence
that we have in Him, that, if we ask
anything according to his will He heareth us,
and if we know that he hear us whatsoever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>we ask, we know that we have the petitions
that we desired of him.” When we ask Him
for the Baptism of the Holy Spirit we know
that we have asked something according to
His will for it is definitely promised in His
word. Therefore we know that “He heareth
us; and if we know that He hear us we know
that we have the petition” which we have
asked of him. As soon then as I am sure I
have met the conditions stated above of the
gift of the Holy Spirit, and asked it of God
I have a right to count this blessing mine—the
prayer is heard and I have the petition I
asked of him—and get up and enter into my
work assured that in my work will be seen
the Spirit’s power. “But,” some one will say,
“shall we expect no manifestations?” Yes,
but where? In service. When I know on the
authority of God’s word that my prayer is
heard, I have the right to enter upon any service
to which He calls me and confidently expect
the manifestation of the Spirit’s power in
that service. It is a mistake to wait or look
for, as so many do, the manifestation in electric
shocks or peculiar emotional experiences.
They may and often do accompany the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit. But the Bible clearly
teaches us (i Cor. <abbr title='12'>xii.</abbr> 4‒11) that the place to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>look for manifestations, is in service and the
most important, reliable and scriptural manifestations
are found in our work. “Must we
not wait,” it may be asked, “until we know
that we have received the baptism of the
Holy Spirit<a id='tn119'></a>?” Most assuredly, but how are
we to know? The same way in which we
know we are saved, <em>by the testimony of God’s
word</em>. When I know I have met the conditions
and have asked this gift which is “according
to his will” I know by God’s word (<abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr>
<abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 14, 15.) that my prayer is heard, and that
I have the petition I desired of him. I have a
right to arise with no other evidence than the
all–sufficient evidence of God’s word, and enter
into the service to which God calls me. “Did
not the early disciples wait ten days?” it may
again be asked<a id='tn119_2'></a>. Yes, and the reason why is
clearly given in Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 1.—“When the day of
Pentecost was fully come.” In the O. T. types
the day of Pentecost had been appointed as
the day in God’s economy for the first giving
of the Holy Spirit and the offering of the first–fruits
(the church) and so the Holy Spirit
could not be given until that day. (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Lev.</abbr> <abbr title='23'>xxiii.</abbr>
9‒17.) But after the Spirit was once given
we find no protracted period of waiting on the
part of those who sought this blessing. (Acts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 31; <abbr title='8'>viii.</abbr> 15, 17; <abbr title='9'>ix.</abbr> 17, 20; <abbr title='19'>xix.</abbr> 6.) Men are
obliged to wait to–day, but it is only because
they have not met the conditions, or do not
believe and claim the blessing simply on the
Word of God. The moment we meet the
conditions and claim the blessing it is ours.
(Mark <abbr title='11'>xi.</abbr> 24 R.V.) Any child of God may lay
down this book, meet the conditions, ask the
blessing, claim it and have it. In a Students’
Summer School at Lake Geneva after a talk
by F. B. Meyer on the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit, a student remained to talk with me.
He said he had heard of this before and had
been seeking it for months but could not get
it. I found his will was not surrendered, but
that was soon settled. Then I said, “Let us
kneel down and ask God for the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit.” He did so. Was that petition
“according to his will?” I asked. “Yes.”
“Was the prayer heard?” After some hesitation,
“It must have been.” “Have you what
you asked of Him?” “I don’t feel it.” I read
<abbr title='First John'>1 Jno.</abbr> <abbr title='5'>v.</abbr> 15 from the Bible that lay open before
us: “If we know that he hears us, whatsoever
we ask, we know that <em>we have</em> the petition
we desired of him.” “Was the prayer
heard?” “Yes.” “Have you what you asked?”
“I must have; for God says so.” We arose and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>soon separated. Going back to the school in
a few days I met the young man again. His
face was now all aglow and he knew he had
received what at first he took upon the bare
word of God.</p>

<p class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>The Repetition of the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit.</span></p>

<p class='c023'>One <a id='tn121'></a>thing more needs to be said before we
leave this subject. <em>The Baptism of the Holy
Spirit is an experience that needs frequent
repeating.</em> This appears from a comparison
of Acts <abbr title='2'>ii.</abbr> 4—where Peter with others was
filled with the Holy Spirit—with Acts <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr>
8.—where Peter was filled again,—and with
Acts <abbr title='4'>iv.</abbr> 31 where Peter with others was
filled yet again. A new filling is needed and
should be sought for each new emergency of
Christian service. There are many who once
knew experimentally what the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit meant who are trying to work to–day
in the power of that old experience and
are working without God. They need and
must have a new Baptism before God can
use them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
